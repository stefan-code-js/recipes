# Pasta Senza Uova (Vegan Semolina Dough) #TabledAdrian #CulinaryArt #Dough #Vegan

**Preface:** A minimalist composition, relying on the strength of semolina and hydration to achieve a resilient, plant-based structure.

**Ingredients**

- **Base:**

  - 280 g fine semolina

  - 130 ml warm water

**Method**

1. Place the semolina on the work surface and form a well.

2. Introduce the warm water gradually, incorporating the semolina with a disciplined hand.

3. Knead the dough for 12 minutes until the mass is smooth and elastic.

4. Wrap tightly and allow to rest at ambient temperature for 45 minutes.

**Technical Notes:** The extended kneading time is critical to activate the gluten in the semolina, compensating for the absence of egg protein.\
**Chef’s Intention:** Restraint in ingredients yields a pure canvas for the accompanying Riviera sauces.\
**Metadata:**

- Season: All

- Ingredient: Semolina

- Dish Type: Pasta\
  **Pairing Suggestion:** Freshly pressed cucumber and mint juice.
