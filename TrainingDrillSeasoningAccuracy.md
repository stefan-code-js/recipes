# Training Drill: Seasoning Accuracy

## Goal

Calibrate palate and team to consistent salinity.

## Practice: Salt

1. Prepare six water samples: 0.2%, 0.4%, 0.6%, 0.8%, 1.0%, 1.2% salt.

2. Blind-taste daily until all cooks can identify within ±0.1%.

## Practice: Acid

1. Prepare acid dilutions (lemon juice).

2. Blind-taste daily until all cooks can identify within ±0.1%.

3. Build a chart of how much “acid brightness” each vinegar adds.
