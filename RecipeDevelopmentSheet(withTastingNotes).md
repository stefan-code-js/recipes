| Field                | Detail                                                                                                |
| -------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Recipe Name**      | \[Name]                                                                                               |
| **Date / Version**   | \[Date] / V\[Number]                                                                                  |
| **Goal**             | \[e.g., Increase viscosity, brighten acid, reduce bitterness]                                         |
| **Change Log**       | \[e.g., Reduced stock reduction from 40% to 35%; increased salt by 0.1%]                              |
| **Tasting Notes**    | \[Date] - Flavor is full, but acid is flat. Needs verjus at the pass. Texture is too thin (no nappé). |
| **Final Parameters** | \[Final Temps, Ratios, Seasoning]                                                                     |
