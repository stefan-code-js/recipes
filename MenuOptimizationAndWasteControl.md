# Menu Optimization and Waste Control

## Menu Planning

- **Trim Utilization**: Plan dishes so one item’s trim becomes another’s base (e.g., carrot peel → stock; bread ends → croutons).

- **Product Diversity**: Avoid products that appear in only one menu item unless it’s a signature.

## Waste Management

- **Rotation**: Rotate perishable ingredients into staff meal or daily special before expiry.

- **Waste Sheet**: Keep a waste sheet: record what and why something was thrown away.

- **Review**: End of week, review waste sheet and fix cause (over-prep, bad forecast, wrong yield).
