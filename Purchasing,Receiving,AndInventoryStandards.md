# Purchasing, Receiving, and Inventory Standards

## Purchasing

- **Specs**: Always order from written specs (name, grade, size, packaging, count, acceptable substitutes).

- **Par Levels**: Track par levels (amount that covers usage between deliveries).

  - _Calculation Example_: 10 kg chicken daily, deliveries every 2 days → par = 20 kg + 1 day safety (10 kg) = 30 kg max.

- **Goal**: Over-par = waste, under-par = 86’s on the line.

## Receiving

- **Checkpoints**: Check temperature, weight, and quality before signing invoice.

- **Rejection**: Reject anything warm, damaged, or with off smell.

- **Speed**: Move quickly into correct storage.

## Inventory Rotation

- **Method**: FIFO (first in, first out).

- **Labeling**: Label every product with delivery date and use-by date.

- **Tracking**: Keep a clipboard in each cooler showing stock movement.
