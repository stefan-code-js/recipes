## Ingredients

- fresh meats, fish, vegetables, and fruits consist mostly of water.
- atmosphere, water is said to be boiling.

## Method

1. drying of foods. The drying of food surfaces as they are cooked enables them to be browned.
2. rier of flavor and of nutritional value. When water carries dissolved compounds, such as salt or sugar, its freezing point is lowered and its boiling point is raised.
3. HEAT MANAGEMENT
4. in order for food to be cooked, heat must be transferred from a heat source (such as a gas flame or an
5. electric element) to and through the food. Understanding the ways in which heat is transferred and
6. the speed at which it is transferred helps the cook control the cooking process.
7. heat traNSFer
8. Heat is transferred in three ways: conduction, convection, and radiation. i t is important to remember that,
9. during a cooking process, more than one of these methods of transfer may be happening at the same time. f or example, food on a grill may be heated by conduction from the hot metal grill, by convection
10. from hot air rising from the burner or charcoal, and by radiation from the glowing burner or coals.
11. 1. When heat moves directly from one item to something touching it-for example, from the top
12. of the range to a soup pot placed on it, from the pot to the broth inside, and from the broth to
13. 2. When heat moves from one part of something to an adjacent part of the same item-for example, from the exterior of a roast to the interior, or from a sauté pan to its handle.
14. different materials conduct heat at different speeds. Heat moves rapidly through copper and
15. aluminum, more slowly in stainless steel, more slowly yet in glass and porcelain. a ir is a poor con-
16. ductor of heat.
17. Convection occurs when heat is spread by the movement of air, steam, or liquid (including hot fat).
18. 1. Natural.
19. Hot liquids and gases rise, while cooler ones sink. Thus, in any oven, kettle of liquid, or deep-fat
20. fryer a constant, natural circulation distributes heat.
21. 2. Mechanical. in convection ovens and convection steamers, fans speed the circulation of heat. Thus, heat is
22. transferred more quickly to the food, and the food cooks faster.
23. stirring is a form of mechanical convection. Thick liquids cannot circulate as quickly as thin
24. ones, so the rate of natural convection is slower. This explains, in part, why it is so easy to scorch thick
25. soups and sauces. The heat is not carried away from the bottom of the pan quickly enough, so it stays concentrated on the bottom and scorches the food. s tirring redistributes the heat and helps pre -
26. vent this. (Using heavy pots made of a material that conducts heat well also helps prevent scorching because the pot conducts the heat more quickly and evenly across the bottom and up the sides.)
