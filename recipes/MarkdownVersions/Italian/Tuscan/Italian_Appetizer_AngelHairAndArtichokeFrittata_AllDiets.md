## Method

1. Preheat the oven to 450°F.
2. In a large pot of lightly salted boiling water, cook the pasta for 2 to 3 minutes or until al dente. Drain and immediately submerge in cold water. Drain again. Set aside.
3. In a small bowl, whisk the eggs until blended. Whisk in the milk and baking powder.
4. Heat the olive oil in an 8-inch ovenproof nonstick skillet over medium heat. Add the pasta and artichoke hearts and toss to mix. Using a spatula, spread the mixture evenly in the pan and then pour the eggs over it, making sure they completely cover the pasta. Cook for 2 to 3 minutes or until the eggs are set on the bottom. Season to taste with salt and pepper.
5. Transfer the skillet to the oven and bake for 2 to 4 minutes or until the eggs are completely cooked through. Remove from the oven and transfer the frittata to a flat plate.
6. Sprinkle with grated cheese and chopped fresh herbs and let the frittata stand for about 5 minutes before slicing into 12 to 16 wedges.
7. Serve immediately on small plates. Top each serving with crème fraîche.
