## Method

1. 50% amplitude over an ice bath, stirring continuously, until the mixture homogenizes
2. completely and goes a pale, opaque pink. Take a portion of the purée out of the batch and place
3. it in a small pot on the stove. Separately, bloom the gelatin in ice water. Warm the purée
4. slightly, wring out the bloomed gelatin, and dissolve it in the warmed purée. Once dissolved, transfer the warmed purée back to the container with the rest of the batch and mix it together
5. thoroughly. Allow the emulsion to set in the fridge.
6. Break up the brunost into small chunks using your hands or a knife. Place it into a dehydrator setto 60°C and dehydrate until almost dry. When the cheese is dry, remove it from the dehydrator,let it cool to room temperature, and give it a quick pulse in the Thermomix to break it up. In a
7. mixing bowl, combine all the dry ingredients. Melt the butter and mix it in as well. Transfer the
8. mixture to the oven set to 140°C (50% fan) and bake it on a parchment- lined tray for 10
9. minutes. Take the soil out of the oven, let it cool slightly and then chill it in the fridge. Once
10. chilled, transfer it to a mortar and pestle to break down any lumps. Combine the cooked soil crumble and dried brown cheese 1:1. Reserve in an airtight container.
11. Bring the cream to 50°C, add the lavender, and allow it to infuse at room temperature for 1 hour. After infusion, strain, and reserve.
12. Place the egg whites in a stand mixer and place the sugar in a saucepot with a splash of water.Place the sugar on the stove to come to temperature. When the sugar hits 100°C you can begin
13. whipping the egg whites. Let the sugar continue to climb to 121°C and then pour it into the e
14. hites, whi ch at this point should be aerated, but not a firm meringue. Let the mixture continu e
15. ipping until the temperature drops to 40°C. Remove the mixture from the bowl and reserve.
