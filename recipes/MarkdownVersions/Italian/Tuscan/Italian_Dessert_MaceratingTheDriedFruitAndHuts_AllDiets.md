## Method

1. enough to hold the levain, stir the sugar into the water until
2. dissolved. Add the diced levain and let soak for 30 minutes.
3. and gives the levain a milder taste.
4. Knead all the ingredients in the bowl of the stand mixer on
5. low speed for 5 minutes, adding a little more milk if the levain
6. is too stiff and won't come together. Turn the levain out onto a
7. it smooth, rotating it 90° clockwise each time. Roll the levain
8. out again, place it on a sheet of plastic wrap greased with a
9. little neutral oil or butter, and roll it up very tightly. Let ferment
10. oven above a bowl of boiling water, for 3 hours.
11. bowl of the stand mixer on low speed until the salt, sugar, and
12. yeast are dissolved and the levain diluted. Add the flour and
13. bowl). Add the remaining sugar and knead until smooth again,
14. then add the butter and knead until the butter is incorporated
15. and the dough completely smooth. With the mixer running

17. should be smooth, very supple, and sticky {bassinage). Add
18. the macerated fruit and nuts and knead until well distributed.
19. (26°C-27°C). Place the dough in a large bowl and cover with
20. plastic wrap. Let ferment for l hour in a steam oven set to 75°F
21. (24°C), or on a rack in a turned-off oven above a bowl of boiling
22. water. After 1 hour, give the dough one fold (see technique ),
23. a bowl of boiling water. Let ferment for an additional l hour. SHAPING AND PROOFING THE PANETTOHES
24. Divide the dough into 2 pieces weighing l lb. (450 g) each and
25. place on a work surface lightly greased with butter. Shape each
26. as you rotate the dough against the work surface. Place in the
27. panettone molds on a baking sheet. Let proof in a steam oven
28. bowl of boiling water, for about 3 hours. The dough should rise
29. to the tops of the molds or slightly above them.
30. Stir together all the ingredients until well combined and trans­
31. Preheat the oven to 300°F (150°C/Gas Mark 2) on fan setting.
32. then sprinkle with sliced almonds and dust with confection­
