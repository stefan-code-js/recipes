## Method

1. Mix all the ingredients together in a bowl until well incorporated. Reserve in a piping bag.
2. Combine 60 g of the tipo “00” flour and 5 g of the malt flour to make your rolling flour.
3. Combine the remaining 75 g tipo “00,” remaining 1.5 g malt flour, the koji flour, and salt with
4. the beer and the rose oil. Knead the dough so that it starts to come together. Add the butter
5. and continue kneading until the dough comes together evenly. Allow the dough to rest for half
6. an hour. Once rested, use a rolling pin to flatten out the ball and then run the dough through apasta machine on setting 1. Dust the dough with the rolling flour mixture so that it is evenly coated and appears a bit darker and punch out circles with a 9.5 cm ring cutter. Grill the
7. flatbread over a barbecue until it puffs slightly and is nicely browned and crisped before service.Reserve the flatbread in a dry airtight container until needed.
8. g Lacto Koji Water* (made with Øland Wheat Koji*)
9. Heat the koji water until it is steaming and emulsify the butter in bit by bit using an immersionblender. Use a pinch of Xantana to help the emulsion bind. Reserve the emulsion warm in a saucepot for service.
