## Method

### Preparation

1. I love rapini, and happily it’s becoming more accepted here. Coming from a traditional Italian family, I grew up eating it with pleasure. My aunt, Dorothy Tramonto, is the queen of “rapi,” as we called it at home. She prepares it with garlic, olive oil, chicken stock, and a little chili pepper and then finishes this much-praised family-style dish with a grating of Parmigiano-Reggiano cheese. I took my cue from her when I developed this contemporary warm winter salad as an amuse, but added the nutmeg to update it. Rapini also answers to the name broccoli rabe.
2. ¼ cup thinly sliced shallots
3. Freshly grated nutmeg, for garnishing
4. Wash the rapini well in cold water and dry thoroughly. Cut the florets off the rapini and coarsely chop the stems and leaves. You should have enough to measure 2 cups.

### Cooking

5. Heat the oil in a medium-sized sauté pan over medium-high heat. Add the shallots and sauté for about 5 minutes or until softened and browned. Add the garlic and cook for an additional 1 to 2 minutes or until the garlic is fragrant. Add the rapini and additional olive oil as needed and sauté for about 5 minutes or until just wilted. Season to taste with salt and pepper.
6. Remove from the heat and divide the rapini among 6 small plates. Drizzle each salad with additional olive oil and garnish with freshly grated nutmeg. Serve warm.
