## Method

1. to come together. Add the butter and continue kneading under the dough comes together evenly. Allow the dough to rest for 30 minutes in the fridge. Once rested, use a rolling pin to flatten out the ball and then run the dough through a pasta machine till you reach setting 2. Cutthe rolled -out flatbread dough into large, manageable rectangles and punch out feathers usin
2. e feather stencil. Out of the edges of the sheet, cut strips of flatbread 11 cm long and 5 mm
3. thick. Roll them into batons like grissini and then twizzle the ends to thin them out slightly. Thiswill serve as the quill of the feather. Using a brush wet with water, run a line down the center o
4. he feather’s vane to help the quill stick. Place the rolled strip in the center of the flatbread to
5. form the quill, pressing it in gently to stick it in plac e. Bake the feather on a sheet tray lined with
6. a Silpat in an oven at 160°C (30% fan) for 10 minutes. (This can be done well before service; store the flatbreads in dry airtight containers.)
7. Place the dried mushrooms in a dehydrator set to 60°C to dry further overnight. The followin
8. ay, blend the mushrooms in a spice grinder or Thermomix until finely powdered, then pass the
9. powder through a fine -mesh nylon sieve. Reserve it in a d ry covered container for service.
10. Rinse the barley briefly under cold water to remove some of the starch. Once rinsed, transfer the barley to a pot and fill it with an ample amount of c old water. Bring the pot to a boil and

13. haphazardly. Once the barley is cooked, drain it well, and do not rinse it. Transfer the barley, st

15. opening on maximum. Once sealed, use a rolling pin to smooth the barley purée out evenly
16. throughout the bag, into every corner and to all the edges. Hold the bag against the light to check the evenness of the barley’s distribution. Use the rolling pin to smooth out the sheet to ensure that the barley is perfectly even all throughout and be sure there are no creases in the
17. plastic bag, or the finished mold pancake will not be a solid sheet. From there, use a sharp box
18. cutter to cut all along the edges of the plastic bag, releasing the two sheets from each other. Carefully peel back the top sheet of plastic, exposing the sheet of barley beneath. Heavily dust
19. the sheet of barley with koji tane and place it, still on the bottom sheet of plastic, into a
20. perforated hotel pan covered with a lid. Place the sheet into an incubator set to 28.5°C at 70% humidity and allow it to ferment for 2 days. Once the koji has finished growing, remove the
