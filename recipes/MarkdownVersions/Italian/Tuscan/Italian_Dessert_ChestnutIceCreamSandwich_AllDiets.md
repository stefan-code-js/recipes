## Method

1. Place both ingredients into the Thermomix and blend them together for 3 minutes on high
2. speed. Afterward, transfer the contents of the Thermomix to a cheesecloth and wring out all theliquid. Afterward, take the harvested chestnut water and strain it through a fine -mesh nylon
3. sieve to remove any residual solids. Place the chestnut liquid in a double boiler on the stove, setto 1 or 2. Cook the liquid down for 1 full day, possibly two, if needed, stirring the liquid occasionally and scraping down the sides to ensure that the chestnut milk doesn’t dry out. Onceit has achieved the proper consistency, remove it from the double boiler. Transfer the paste to
4. around over the heat. Cook the mixture until it begins to caramelize and steams off enough moisture that it no longer sticks to the pan. While still warm, place t he chestnut mass into a
5. air and to pound out any clumps that may have formed while cooking. Once completely cool, vacuum seal the paste in a bag and reserve i n the fridge.
6. Black currant leaf, approximately 6 cm long and 6.5 cm wide
7. Coat your hands with a bit of fat spray. Tear off a small portion of the chestnut mochi and workit in your hands until it becomes wa rm and pliable like a pasta dough. From there, squash it
8. between two pieces of parchment paper coated with a thin layer of fat spray. Run the mochi through the pasta roller until you reach setting 2.5 and you’ve attained a thin, even sheet. Tak
9. o that they mirror each other. Maintain the overall shape of the leaf, and do not worry about
10. the edge details. Cut the three thickest veins on the leaf in half with a knife, otherwise they w ill
11. Spray the black currant leaf with fat spray, place it face down on the mochi sheet so that the
12. veins of the leaf are pressed into the mochi sheet. Add some fat spray to another parchment square and put this on top of the leaf. Through the parchment square, gently press the leaf into
13. the mochi sheet by applying pressure from the lowest part of the leaf up and away from the center stem. The goal of this process is to leave an imprint of the le af and its veins in the mochi
14. sheet. Be careful with this process, so as not to break through the mochi sheet by applying toomuch pressure. Carefully remove the top parchment sheet from the mochi and use a small knifeto scrape along the edge of the black currant leaf, removing the excess mochi. Reserve this
15. trimmed and pressed chestnut mochi leaf in a container in the fridge.
