## Method

1. it to a simmer. The barley should be well cooked -like al dente pasta -but not overcooked. This is
2. the one of the most crucial steps in the process and should not be done haphazardly. Once the barley is cooked, drain it well, and do not rinse it. Transfer the barley, still warm, to the Thermomixand purée it on maximum until well broken up. From there, transfer 230 g of the barley to a 30 x 40
3. cm vacuum bag, and seal it a couple centimeters from the opening on maximum. Once sealed, use
4. the edges. Hold the bag against the light to check the evenness of the barley’s distribution. Use therolling pin to smooth out the sheet to ensure that the barley is perfectly even all throughout and be
5. sure there are no creases in the plastic bag or the finished mold pancake will not be a solid sheet.
6. From there, use a sharp box cutter to cut all along the edges of the plastic bag, releasing the two sheets from each other. Carefully peel back the top sheet of plastic, exposing the sheet of barley beneath. Heavily dust the sheet of barley with koji tane and place it, still on the bottom sheet of plastic, into a perforated hotel pan covered with a lid. Place the sheet into an incubator set to 28.5°Cat 70% humidity and allow it to ferment for 2 days. Once the koji has finished growing, remove thesheets from the incubator, and transfer them to the fridge to cool down to fridge temperature to
7. stop fermentation. From there, punch the mold sheets out into discs with an 8.6 cm ring mold.
8. Reserve them on parchment squares in covered containers in the fridge until needed.
