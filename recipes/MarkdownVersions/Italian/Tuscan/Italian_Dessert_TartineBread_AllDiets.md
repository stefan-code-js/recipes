## Method

1. 8-ounce jars. To sterilize the jars, place them upright in a large pot, add hot water
2. to cover the jars, bring to a boil, and boil for 15 minutes. Place the lids and bands
3. in a saucepan, add hot water to cover, bring to a boil, and boil for 15 minutes.
4. lifter-and rinse with hot water. Remove the jars, lids, and bands from the boiling
5. water and set aside on a clean work surface.
6. Wash the fruit and remove any stems or leaves. Cut the fruit into ½- to
7. 1-inch pieces or slices. Combine the fruit, sugar, and lemon juice in a non reactive
8. pot, making sure that the fruit is 3 inches below the rim of the pot. If you are using
9. grams of fruit into the pot. Cook the fruit over medium heat, stirring, until
10. the fruit starts to release its juices and the sugar begins to dissolve.
11. Raise the heat to high and continue to cook the fruit, stirring as needed
12. to prevent the fruit from sticking to the bottom of the pot. When foam starts to
13. form on the top of the fruit, skim it off with the ladle or wooden spoon. The jam
14. will bubble vigorously at first and then will bubble more slowly. When the jam
15. reaches 220° to 222°F on a thermometer, turn off the heat and wait a few minutes
16. for the temperature to come down a few degrees. If the jam is put immediately
17. into jars, the fruit will float to the top of the syrup. The temperature to which
18. jam is cooked is the same for all fruits and all types of preserving: 221°F at sea level.
19. For every 1,000 feet above sea level, subtract 2°F.
20. Using the funnel and ladle, fill jars to within ⅛ inch of the rims. Remove
21. any drips with a clean towel. Top with the lids and seal with the screw bands.
