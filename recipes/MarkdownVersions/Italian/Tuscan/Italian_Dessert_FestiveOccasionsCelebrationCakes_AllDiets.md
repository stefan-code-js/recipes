4. 10.5 oz. ( 300 g) pastry cream
5. (see technique , adding food
6. Preheat the oven to 350° F (180° C/Gas mark 4 ). Beat the eggs and egg yolks with
7. 4.25 oz. ( 120 g) of the sugar until light. Add the invert sugar, emulsifier, and soft -
8. ened almond paste, mixing well. Whisk the egg whites with the remaining sugar
9. and salt until stiff. Sift together the flour and starch. Fold the whites into the egg mixture and then carefully fold in the sifted flour and starch. Pour into 1 or 2 yule log
10. molds (depending on their size) and bake for about 30 minutes. Slice horizontally
11. Whisk the kirsch, hot water, and sugar together. Let the sugar dissolve fully, stirring from time to time. Set aside at room temperature.
12. Bring the milk to a boil in a saucepan with the vanilla bean and seeds. Whisk the egg yolks with the sugar until thick and light. Sift together the starch and milk powder and then carefully fold in. Whisk some of the hot milk into the egg mixture, add the rest of the milk, and return to the heat. Stir until it just comes to a boil, remove from the heat, and set aside.
13. Heat the water with 3.5 oz. ( 100 g) of the sugar until the sugar dissolves and then
14. cook to 243° F (117°C). Beat the egg whites to soft peaks and add the remaining sugar,
15. continuing to whisk until stiff. Using the electric beater, whisk the hot sugar syrup into the egg whites until they are completely cold. Set aside 2.5 oz. ( 70 g) for this
16. recipe, covering the remaining meringue with plastic wrap and freezing for future use.
17. Loosen the pastry cream. Warm the butter slightly and whisk until creamy. Carefully add it to the pastry cream until evenly combined. Fold in the Italian meringue and set aside at room temperature.
18. Heat the kirsch over a bain-marie to 86°F (30°C). Loosen the cold pastry cream with a
19. spatula and then warm it over a bain-marie to 86° F (30°C). Pour in the kirsch and fold
20. in the buttercream. Stir in a little red food coloring. Set aside at room temperature.
21. Place the first layer of genoise on the cake board, moisten it with kirsch syrup and, using the pastry bag with the plain tip, pipe a layer of mousseline cream over it. Carefully place a second genoise layer on top and moisten it with syrup. Pipe over another thin layer of mousseline cream, place the last layer of moistened genoise on top, and cover the entire cake with mousseline cream, smoothing the surface with a spatula. Freeze the cake for 1 hour and then chill in the refrigerator for 30 minutes
22. (to avoid condensation). Dust a work surface with confectioners’ sugar and roll out the almond paste about
23. -⅛ in. (2-3 mm) thick. Roll the embossed rolling pin over
24. it. Remove the cake from the refrigerator and cover it smoothly with the textured almond paste. Whip the remaining mousseline cream, spoon it into the pastry bag with a fluted tip, and pipe rosettes on top of the log. Finish with pink meringues and pink and white chocolate disks.
