## Method

1. Good memories are often the best teachers, and I have a mouthwatering remembrance of a classic Italian panzanella salad Chef Joe Decker served at Lettuce Entertain You’s Chicago restaurant Avanzare, which means “to advance or go forward.” I worked with Joe as a sous-chef when I first moved to Chicago and began working for Lettuce Entertain You. This predated my four-year odyssey in Europe, and when I returned, Joe had moved on to other Lettuce restaurants and I became the chef of Avanzare. Much later, I opened Tru in the same space Avanzare had occupied-but now I was the chef-owner. I immediately remembered the salad but made the medley of tomatoes, bread, basil, and olive oil more upscale for Tru’s fine-dining menu. When I serve it as an amuse, I mix tiny dice of red and yellow tomatoes, always seeking out the best and ripest heirloom varieties, and serve it with buttermilk crackers instead of bread. As Albert Einstein once said: “Imagination is more important than knowledge.”
2. cup diced red and yellow tomatoes
3. Currant tomatoes on the vine, for garnishing
4. In a small bowl, toss the tomatoes with the olive oil. Season to taste with salt and pepper.
5. To serve, divide the tomato salad among 6 small plates and drizzle with the vinegar. Top each serving with a shaving of cheese, a cracker, and a few currant tomatoes.
