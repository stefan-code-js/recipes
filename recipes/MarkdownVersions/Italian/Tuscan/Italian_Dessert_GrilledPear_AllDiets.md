## Method

1. heather flowers
2. Blanch the thyme on its stems for 4-5 minutes until very tender.
3. Cool in ice water and pull off the stems. Strain to obtain all the
4. leaves and squeeze through a Superbag to remove the remaining
5. water. Keep dry on kitchen paper (paper towels). Pick the leaves
6. from the parsley and blanch them until tender. Dry as for the
7. thyme. Process the oil and herbs in a Thermomix at full speed
8. on 60°C ( 140°F) for 12 minutes. Cool, then macerate for 24 hours.
9. keep in a small squeezy bottle.
10. Peel the pears and cut in thick slices lengthways. Remove the cores
11. and char-grill 1 slice per person on one side only. Take the pears off
12. the heat and rub thyme oil and salt into them to taste.
13. sieve (strainer). Saute the shallots and thyme in a little oil in a pan
14. and add the puree. Let the mix cook for 2 minutes and add the beer.
15. Reduce to half and add the duck glace. The consistency of the final
16. sauce must be like that of an Italian ragu or bolognese sauce.
17. Warm the plates. Place a slice of pear on each plate and heat the
18. sauce. Add the thyme flowers to the sauce and split it with plenty
19. of thyme oil. Drizzle sauce around the pear, sprinkle with the
