## Method

1. In a stand mixer set up with a paddle attachment, mix all the dry ingredients and then add the
2. egg whites, pouring them in slowly. Allow the mixer to run for 1 minute. Heat the bee larvae
3. butter to about 50°C and then pour in the melted butter to the mixer. Allow the mixer to run for
4. secon ds further and then remove the bowl. Pour the mixture, 35 g at time, into the red
5. silicone 8 cm round cake molds. Transfer the mold to a tray in a combi oven set to dry heat at
6. 170°C (40% fan) and fan for 7 minutes, turning the tray around halfway through for even cooking.
7. Remove the sponge, allow it to cool to room temperature, and then pop the sponges out of th
8. olds. Then, over a medium -hot barbecue, begin grilling the sponge until it caramelizes on its
9. face. Flip the sponge over and brush the caramel ized face with a full coating of bee pollen glaze.
10. Once the other side has caramelized, flip the sponge again and brush this caramelized side withthe bee pollen glaze. Once both glazed sides are caramelized, remove the sponge from the
11. barbecue and place them onto a tray. Brush the grilled sponge generously on both sides with
12. sea buckthorn syrup. Allow it to sit for 15 minutes to soak up the syrup.
13. rehydrate. Afterward, transfer it to the Thermomix and blend it on high speed until completely
14. puréed. Remove it from the blender and set aside.
15. Place the egg whites in a stand mixer and place the sugar in a pot with a splash of water. Place
16. the sugar on the stove to come to temperature. When the sugar hits 100°C you can begin
17. whipping the egg whites. Let the sugar continue to climb to 121°C and then slowly pour it intothe mixing egg whites, which at this point should be aerated, but not a firm meringue. Let themixture continue whipping until the temperature drops to 40°C. Remove the mixture from thebowl and reserve.
