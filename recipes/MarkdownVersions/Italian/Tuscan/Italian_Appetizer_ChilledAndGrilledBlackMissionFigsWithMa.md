## Method

1. The name Tramonto means “sunset” in Italian, which makes it fun for me to travel there; I can always find postcards with my name on them. One of the best times I had in Italy was in 2001, when I represented the United States at the International Prosciutto di Parma Festival in Parma, along with representatives from seven other countries. The event celebrated Italy’s magnificent ham, or prosciutto. Being in Parma was amazing: It’s the home of three of life’s greatest luxuries: Parma ham, Parmigiano-Reggiano cheese, and the Ferrari. Rightly so, Italians are purists when it comes to their prosciutto, and so I decided to keep it simple. I paired the ham with figs, which is a classic combination in Parma, and then added mascarpone cheese, an equally classic accompaniment. To sweeten the figs, I grilled them; to lighten the velvety and sinfully rich cheese, I made it into a foam. I am proud to say that the dish placed second in the competition, and I have since modified it as an amuse, which is nothing short of a mouthful of intense flavor and textures.
2. A taste of authentic Parma ham is all you need to understand why it’s revered the world over. Made from the pork of relatively young pigs that are raised on a careful diet in this mountainous region of Italy and then cured with painstaking care for ten to twelve months, the ham is fragrant, not overly salty, and luxuriously streaked with fat. All good ham should be sliced shortly before it’s served, and this is particularly true for Parma and other quality prosciutto. It’s usually shipped from Italy already cut from the bone but fastidiously wrapped. Slice it paper thin for the best flavor and texture. If you cannot find prosciutto di Parma ham, skip this dish until you can. It’s not hard to locate and you’ll be glad you waited.

4. Slice the figs in half through the stem.
5. Lightly grease a grill pan and heat over medium-high heat.
6. While the pan is heating, put the melted butter in a shallow bowl and the sugar in another. Coat each fig half with melted butter and then roll in the sugar.
7. Grill the coated figs in the hot pan, turning once, for 2 to 3 minutes or until just softened. Season to taste with salt and pepper. Refrigerate until needed.
8. To serve, put a slice of ham on each of 6 small plates. Arrange a fig half on the ham. Shake the foamer vigorously and garnish each fig with a small dab of mascarpone foam. Wrap the ends of the ham slice around the fig and mascarpone foam.
9. Put the mascarpone cheese in a medium-sized bowl and soften it by gently folding it over on itself with a rubber spatula. Slowly mix in the cream so that the mixture is smooth and the cream is thoroughly incorporated. Season to taste with salt and pepper.
10. Pour the mixture into the chilled canister of a foamer. Charge with 1 or 2 charges. Chill before using.
