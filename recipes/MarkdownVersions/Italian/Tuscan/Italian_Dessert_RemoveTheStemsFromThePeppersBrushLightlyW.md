## Method

1. over a very hot barbecue. Rotate the peppers as they cook; they should be completely blackened on the outsid e. This process will take approximately 15 minutes. Once blackened,
2. transfer the peppers to a gastro, and allow them to rest uncovered for 30 minutes. Once rested,
3. blackened skin from the flesh (the reserved juices can be added to the pepper reduction -see
4. above). Vacuum seal the peeled flesh between parchment paper, and steam at 80°C (50% fan)for a minimum of 12 hours or up to 16 hours (ideally overnight).
5. Once steam ed, shock the peppers in an ice bath. Carefully remove the steamed peppers from
6. the vacuum bags, as they will be quite delicate. Discard the cooking juices from the bags and transfer the cooked peppers to a dehydrator. Brush each side of the peppers with s moked koji
7. oil. Dry at 68°C for 30 minutes. After 30 minutes, flip the peppers, brush with smoked koji oil, and continue to dry for an additional 30 minutes. After 1 hour total of drying, remove the
8. and return the peppers to the dehydrator for 30 minutes. After 30 minutes, remove the
9. minutes. At this point, check the peppers for doneness as they are drying-depending on the
10. size of the peppers, some will finish before others. The drying process should take 2 to 2½ hourstotal.
11. Once semi -dried, spray the peppers with a bit of aerosolized fat and place them between
12. parch ment squares. Roll the peppers in the parchment squares in a pasta machine, starting at
13. setting 3 and working your way down incrementally to setting 2.
14. Place the rolled pepper meat in the pepper reduction for approximately 10 minutes. Be awarethat there will be a lot of variation from capsicum to capsicum, so you will have to pay attentionto each piece of semi -dried pepper meat to determine how long it should be soaked for. The
15. idea with rehydrating the semi -dried peppers is to create a more meltingly te nder texture.
16. PEPPER MEAT SPICE MIX
17. Toast the juniper berries, black pepper, coriander, and star anise. Blend together with the thyme, ginger, and salt. Store in an airtight container; blend fresh daily.
