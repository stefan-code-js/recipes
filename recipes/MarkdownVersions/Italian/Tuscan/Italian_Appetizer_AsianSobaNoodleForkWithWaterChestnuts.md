## Method

1. No amuse is more appealing and fun than this one of Asian noodles twirled around a fork. When I was growing up, my mother cooked pasta on Sundays for as long as I can remember, as did most Italian home cooks. When my father and I dipped into the food cooking on the stove, my mom constantly chided us to “take just a forkful!” When I was creating this amuse, I thought of my mother’s words and tried serving one on a fork. After a little experimentation, I discovered that soba noodles worked beautifully-not as heavy as linguine and with a delightful texture. When tossed with this sauce, the noodles explode with flavor.
2. I like this sauce so much, I keep a jar of it at all times in my home refrigerator to toss on noodles, use as a marinade for chicken, beef, or pork, and even sprinkle over greens as a salad dressing. I got the idea for it from a noodle shop on Copperwell Street in San Francisco, where noodles were served at a small counter. The owner sold bottles of a sauce quite like this; I bought a few, took them back to my kitchen, and worked out something similar.
3. One 8-ounce can water chestnuts, drained and very thinly sliced
4. In a saucepan filled with lightly salted boiling water, cook the noodles for 2 to 3 minutes or until al dente. Drain and rinse under cold running water. Drain again.
5. Transfer the cool noodles to a medium bowl. Add the water chestnuts, snow peas, red and yellow peppers, and carrot and toss to mix. Sprinkle the sauce over the noodles and toss until the noodles are coated but not wet. Do not use more sauce than needed.
6. To serve, twirl a decorative fork in the noodles, securing enough for 1 generous bite. Lay the fork on a small plate and garnish with a shaving of pecorino cheese. Repeat to make 5 more servings.
