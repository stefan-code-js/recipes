## Method

1. pot and fold in the butter, beating out any lumps quickly, to avoid overworking the starch, and then add the warm liquids, watching the consistency as you do so. This should be done just prior
2. or 7 cooked small new potatoes
3. Set up a terra- cotta herb pot with a ramekin placed inside and preheat the dish in an oven to
4. 135°C. Take the largest of the cooked new potatoes and slice off the bottom to keep i t from
5. rolling around. With the tip of a pipette, make a hole in the potato, and leave the pipette sticking out. In a small pot on the stove, heat up the elderflower emulsion and warm all the new
6. potatoes in it. Have the freshly made potato purée warm and on hand. Place the potato with the
7. pipette stuck in it directly into the middle of the ramekin and place the remaining potatoes
8. around. Season the potatoes with a bit of salt and pipe a dot of the elderflower fudge on top o
9. ch potato. Sprinkle the fresh elderflowers over the potatoes. Drizzle the pipette of
10. elderflower oil over the top of everything in the ramekin, and cover everything with a generousspoonful of the potato purée, that reaches out to the edges of the dish. Place the mushroom soilinto a coarse sieve, and push the mushroom soil through to form an even layer that only just
11. covers the purée. After that, add a bit more of the soil with your fingers to make it look natural.Finally, remove the pipette from the potato and quickly replace it wit h the pluche of nasturtium
12. vine to make it resemble a plant sprouting out of the earth. Serve immediately.
