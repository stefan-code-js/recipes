## Method

1. 1. either line the mold with aspic, following the procedure on page 864, or pour a layer of aspic into the bottom of the mold. chill until firm.
2. 2. arrange a layer of garnish in the mold.
3. 3. add just enough aspic jelly to cover the solid garnish. chill until firm.
4. 4. repeat steps 2 and 3 until the mold is full.
5. 5. for best storage, leave the aspic in the mold, covered tightly with plastic film, until service time.
6. often very elegant. a nother approach is simply to combine the jelly with a mixture of ingredients
7. and fill the terrine with this mixture. a clarified aspic may not be necessary for this method. terrines
8. made this way range from coarse, peasant-style dishes to more elaborate constructions.
9. this type of terrine. tripes à la Mode de c aen (), when properly made, can also be chilled until
10. dients. Jambon p ersillé, or p arsleyed ham (), is another example of a country-style aspic-based
11. terrine made with unclarified jelly.

13. whipped heavy cream. (i t is true that the terms mousse and mousseline are often used more or less

17. Because mousses, like aspics, are not cooked after assembly but merely chilled, they are often
18. prepared not only in terrines but also in decorative, irregularly shaped molds. the production of
19. mousses is relatively simple. the procedure consists of four main steps:
20. 1. purée the main ingredient.
21. 2. add the aspic jelly or dissolved gelatin.
22. 3. fold in the lightly whipped cream and season to taste.
