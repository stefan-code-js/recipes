## Method

1. Melt the butter and, with a small whisk, stir in the salt to dissolve. Reserve the butter warm for
2. service, stirring it before use. Also be sure the keep the side of the pot clean with a rubber
3. spatula to prevent salt from crystallizing out of the liquid.
4. not to create a mess or stain the squid’s flesh. Pull the cuttlebone out (this is the clear
5. “backbone” that looks like plastic). Gently place your fingers under the flaps and go around the
6. squid to remove them and some of the outer skin. Reserve the flaps and tentacles fo r staff food.
7. Place your knife inside the hood and follow the natural seam in the squid. Once opened, rinse
8. the squid quickly and gently under cold water, and then lay it flat onto the cutting board so thatthe inner side of the squid is facing you. Make a n incision at the bottom end of the squid, about
9. cm up from the wing-shaped bottom edge. Cut 90% of the way through the squid -do not cut
10. all the way through it. After making the cut, flip the squid over so that the outer side of it is facing you, grab the bottom part of the squid where you made the cut, and peel the skin and membrane off using gray towels. Once peeled, use towels to wipe of any residual membrane orskin from the exterior and the interior of the squid. Using a knife, harvest only the center- cut,
11. thickest, portion of the squid’s hood in 10 cm square portions (reserve all other portions for another application). Place the squares of squid on a flat tray lined with parchment and freeze.As soon as it is frozen, seal it in an airtight container.
12. Remove the parchment paper and place the frozen square of squid in a vacuum bag. Add
13. enough spruce wood oil to coat and seal on maximum. Cook the squid in a water bath at 60°C
14. for 15 minutes. Once cooked, shock the squid in an ice bath to cool it down. Remove the squid
15. from the bag and slice it into 1.5 mm slices with an extremely sharp knife.
16. Starting close to you and working away from yourself, lay 12 strips of the cooked squid onto
17. rectangular sheet (the sheet should weight approximately 30 g). Reserve these shingled portions
18. of cooked squid in the fridge till service.
19. portion cooked Squid
20. Roasted Kelp Butter
21. Temper the squid portions for at least 30 minutes before service. Lay the portion of squid on a
22. the opposite corner in the top left, rolling it over as you do so. Transfer the loosely rolled squid to a black currant wood mat. Baste the squid on the mat over an empty container with warm
23. (65° to 70°C) roasted kelp butter two or three times to coat it. Transfer the mat with the glazed squid to a bowl and serve.
