1. Find the biggest dried walnuts you can possibly find. Set a combi oven to 90°C dry heat, with
2. 70% humidity (30% fan). Lay the walnuts in one flat layer in the oven for a few minutes. Once warmed, retrieve the walnuts, and shave the skin off using a very sharp knife. Split the shavedwalnuts in half and trim the edges. From each half of the walnut, you should be able to get 2 wicks cut approximately into the shape and size of matchsticks -approximately 3 mm thick.
3. Reserve the walnut wicks in an airtight conta iner until service.
4. Combine the cardamom and the water in a container. Using an immersion blender, blend till thecardamom is broken apart and infused into the water. Strain the mixture through a fine -mesh

7. prevent the candle from st icking to the plate) and keep them in the blast freezer. When called
8. out, put the candle on the cold plate, spray it once with cardamom perfume, and place the wickin the candle. Double -check that the candle is not too frozen. Light the wick just before leaving
