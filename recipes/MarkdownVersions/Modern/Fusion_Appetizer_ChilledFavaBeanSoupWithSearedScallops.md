## Method

1. Fava beans are part of a springtime triumvirate, joining asparagus and peas as a cherished sign of the season. If you’ve never cooked them before, trying them in this amuse is a good way to learn how and to involve your guests in the kitchen. You may find peeling the beans a pleasant, if fleeting, rite of spring, as I do. Searing brings out the scallops’ sweetness, which complements the butteriness of the beans for a rich, intoxicating soup that can be served hot or cold. If you can find scallops in the shells, buy them, and then serve the soup directly in the delicate shells for a spectacular presentation.
2. The first time I tasted fava beans and scallops together was at the legendary Swiss restaurant Fredy Giradet in the early 1990s. The restaurant was so remote, I had to take a plane, train, and automobile to get there, but the chef’s cooking left me with the impression of a lifetime.
3. Lobster roe, for garnishing
4. Grated orange zest, for garnishing
5. In a large pot of boiling water, blanch the peas for 2 to 5 minutes or until done (to test for doneness, bite into a pea). Drain and immediately submerge in cold water. Drain again.
6. In a large pot of boiling water, blanch the peeled fava beans for 3 to 6 minutes or until done (to test for doneness, bite into a bean). Drain and immediately submerge in cold water. Drain again.
7. Transfer the peas and fava beans to a blender. Add the ¼ cup water and puree until smooth. Add 1 tablespoon of the oil and puree again until well combined. Strain through a
8. or fine-mesh sieve into a medium-sized bowl. If needed, gently stir in more water until the soup reaches the consistency you prefer. Stir in the orange juice and season to taste with salt and white pepper. Cover and chill.
9. Heat the remaining 1 tablespoon oil in a cast-iron skillet over high heat until almost smoking. Cook the scallops for about 2 minutes on each side or until well browned. Transfer to a plate.
10. To serve, pour about 2 tablespoons of the chilled soup into a small soup cup and top with a scallop half, seared side up. Garnish with lobster roe and orange zest. Repeat to make 5 more servings.
