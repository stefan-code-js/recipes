## Method

1. or from a good bakery
2. tomato, very thinly sliced
3. With a sharp knife, cut the foie gras into 8 slices.
4. Heat a dry cast-iron skillet over medium-high heat. When hot, sauté the foie gras for about 1 minute on each side or until lightly browned. Drain on paper towels.
5. Use 3 slices of brioche for each sandwich.
6. Assemble each sandwich by spreading aioli on each slice of brioche. Top the bottom slice of brioche with a slice of foie gras, a tomato slice, some microsprouts, and another slice of bread. Top this with another slice of foie gras, another tomato slice, and more sprouts. Lay the third slice of brioche on top, aioli side down. Repeat for each sandwich. Cut in half and serve.
7. Put the egg yolks in a small bowl and whisk with a wire whisk. Whisking constantly, slowly add ¼ cup oil. Begin very slowly, a few drops at a time. When the oil is emulsified, add the remaining ¼ cup oil in a steady stream.
8. Stir the lemon juice into the mayonnaise. Set aside.
9. Put the basil leaves, garlic, pine nuts, and cheese in a food processor fitted with a metal blade. With the machine running, add the 2 tablespoons oil and process until emulsified.
10. Stir the basil mixture into the mayonnaise. Season to taste with salt and pepper. Use immediately or cover and refrigerate for up to 3 days. Whisk before using.
