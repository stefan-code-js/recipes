3. and continue to sauté the mixture for 5 minutes more. Add the lacto koji water, the lacto cep water, and the fennel juice and bring the mixture up to a boil. Once up to temperature, skim th

5. and the dried chanterelles. Reduce the heat on the induction burner to power 2 and simmer the
6. mixture for 25 to 30 minutes, at which point the liquid will have reduced by half. Pass the contents of the pot through a conical strainer, then a fine -mesh nylon sieve, and finally through
