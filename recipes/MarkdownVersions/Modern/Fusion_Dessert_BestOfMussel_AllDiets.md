## Method

1. submerging them in ice water for 2 hours in the fridge. Once purged, fill a large sauté pan withenough water to fill the base 0.5 cm. Bring the water up to a boil and start cooking 12 mussels ata time. Cook the mussels, moving them around, for 20 to 30 seconds, until they just barely beginto open. Remove them from the pan, off to the side. Use a turning knife to carefully open the mussels, making sure not to damage the cheeks of the shellfish. Be sure that the best mussel shells (of medium size and nice shape and without any blemishes) aren’t damaged or broken inhalf when you’re opening the mussels, either, as they’re to be used as the serving vessel for th
2. ish. Using around 6 mussels per portion, carve off the cheeks of the mussel and reserve them
3. on parchment. We want to use just the cheeks as they are the sweetest, most pure part of th e
4. ussel. Reserve the remainder of the mussel for the purée below.
5. Lacto Koji Water* (made with Øland Wheat Koji*)
6. After butchering off the lips, transfer the remainder of the mussels to a nonstick pan and cookthem over medium heat with 3 times their weight in smoked butter, stirring the contents and scraping anything off the bottom as it cooks, until the mussel flesh begins to caramelize, approximately 15 minutes. Strain the caramelized flesh from the butter. Weigh out the cookedmussel flesh and meas ure an equal amount in lacto koji water. Transfer the cooked mussel flesh
7. to the Thermomix and blend it with the strained butter in a slow and steady stream to emulsify,then let it down with the koji water until you yield a smooth, emulsified purée. Once blended, pass the fudge through a tamis lined with a fine -mesh nylon sieve. Once passed, keep the purée
8. in a piping bag at room temperature for service.
9. Lacto K oji Water* ( made with Ø land Wheat Koji*)
10. lay it open, b utterflied o nto a heated p late of rocks. On e ach s ide o f the s hell, lay 1 o r 2 o f the
11. filleted mussel lips, placing the larg est o ne on t he very bottom. Pipe e nough o f the m ussel fudge
12. more lips over the top. Pipe enough of the mussel fudge to cover 50% of the surface of the l ips
13. layer. Each stack of mussel cheeks in each side of the mussel shell should be 5 to 7 cheeks high.
14. Brush the top lips with melted butter and season with a bit of salt. Finally, finish with a spritzing
15. of the lacto koji water. Cover the plate with a lid and serve.
