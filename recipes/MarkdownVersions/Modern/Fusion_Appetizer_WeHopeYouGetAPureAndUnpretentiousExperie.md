7. level of concentration make it more meaningful for the cooks, who get
8. a restaurant, namely the sensation and emotion of giving. And at the
9. same time they realize that their work is appreciated', explains Rene.
10. the vagaries of the season, so changes to the menu are gradual but
11. constant. The tempo is dictated by the availability of raw materials.
12. As a result, there is no fixed structure to the compilation of a menu.
13. All the same, Rene endeavours to keep some degree of consistency .

17. with a seafood repertoire. Next come the courses that are easier to
18. prepare and the partly pre-cooked courses, where vegetables play
19. an important part. Then the desserts usher in the finale.
20. 'You would not be served an overly filling and heavilly cooked
21. series of courses in Noma,' says Rene. 'A piece of braised meat is
22. an overall impression of sbmething light and succulent. When you
23. pleasantly full and in a light state of mind. The menu is constructed
24. in such a way that you arrive at that state step-by-step. We create

31. ever before. The routines and thought processes of his previous
32. workplaces no longer haunt Noma's menu, and that is absolutely
33. taste experiences we want to leave the guests with. Now it's all up to
34. us. Our challenge for many years to come will lie more in continuing
35. circles and repeat ourselves. The autopilot is our worst enemy. For the

41. The Raw Materials through the Seasons
42. It's no use dwelling on the seasons when you are expounding on the
43. subject of Scandinavian raw materials. Not nostalgically, at any rate.
44. Every season has its charms, its characteristics, and that's part of
45. what makes life in N oma's kitchen a dynamic affair. 'I am very fond
46. of winter, but in the end I find I get tired of it,' admits Rene. 'Then spring

50. Noma's existence -both its Achilles heel and a blessing.
51. Rene has come to terms with the harsh, weather -beaten realities.
52. In fact he wouldn't have it any other way. The constant changes mean
53. colleagues in the kitchen from lulling themselves to sleep. 'In many
54. nothing. But it's certainly true for us. The raw materials are king, and
55. transport them. We must have the absolute best raw materials that,
56. even in the simple ways we serve them, can do something that other
57. raw materials cannot do', he explains.
