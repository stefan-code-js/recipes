3. cookie cutter
4. Acetate sheetsStick blender10 × 3-in. and 4 -in.
5. 2.25 oz. ( 65 g) freshly ground
6. 5.25 oz. ( 155 g) ground toasted
7. chocolate, chopped8.5 oz. ( 240 g) almond praline

11. Gallimousse expansion agent1 oz. ( 25 g) Louis François
12. 2.5 oz. ( 70 g) milk couverture
13. ¼ tbsp ( 17.5 g) gelatin powder
14. Infuse the coffee for the sponge in the cold water overnight. Infuse the coffee for
15. the buttercream in the cold milk for 24 hours. Roast the beans for the jelly at 450° F
16. (230° C/Gas mark 8 ) for 10 minutes, then soak in the cold water for 24 hours.
17. Preheat the oven to 350° F (180° C/Gas mark 4 ). Whisk the eggs with the yolks,
18. confectioners’ sugar, and ground hazelnuts. Whisk the whites with the brown sugar to soft peaks. Stir the hazelnut paste and oil into the egg mixture, then fold in the whisked whites and finally the sifted flour and cornstarch. Spread about 1 lb. 9 oz.
19. (700 g) over the silicone mat and bake for 8-10 minutes. Remove from the oven and
20. let cool. Cut out 30 sponge disks using the cookie cutter. Strain the coffee-infused
21. MAKING THE MOCHA PRALINE CRISPMelt the chocolate to 104° F (40°C) over a bain-marie. Mix the other ingredients
22. together, stir into the melted chocolate, and quickly spread thinly over an acetate sheet on a baking sheet. Allow to set and then use the cookie cutter to cut out 10 disks.
23. Heat the cream, dextrose, and sorbitol. Melt the chocolate, pour over the hot cream, mix well, and then process with the stick blender until smooth and glossy.
24. Strain the coffee-infused milk and bring ⅓ cup ( 75 ml) to a boil. Whisk the egg, yolk,
25. and sugar together until pale, then whisk in the coffee-infused milk as for a custard. When it cools to 104° F (40°C), whisk in the butter and then add the coffee paste.
26. In a saucepan, heat the invert sugar and glucose until melted. Pour over the egg whites in the stand mixer, whisking until stiff. Cool completely and fold into the buttercream.
27. Whisk all the ingredients together until frothy and fold into the buttercream.
28. Melt all the ingredients together over a bain-marie.
29. Strain the coffee-bean infusion: you need a scant 1 cup ( 200 ml). Soak the gelatin in
30. the cold water. Heat one-third of the infusion and stir in the gelatin and sugar until dissolved. Remove from the heat, stir in the remaining infusion, and pour into the 3-in. ( 7-cm) tartlet rings. Place in the refrigerator to set, then cut into small cubes.
31. Pipe 4 tsp (20 g) of coffee cream into each 4-in. ( 8-cm) ring and top with a disk of
32. moistened sponge. Pipe ganache on top and add a second layer of sponge. Pipe over about 2 tsp ( 10 g) of coffee cream, and finish with the praline crisp stuck to the
33. remaining sponge layer. Chill until firm. Unmold and use the glaze at 104° F (40°C)
34. to coat the cakes completely. Decorate with a few chopped toasted hazelnuts, 4 or
