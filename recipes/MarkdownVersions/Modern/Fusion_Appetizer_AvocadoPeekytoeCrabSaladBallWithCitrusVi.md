## Method

1. It’s not easy to make luscious, velvety avocados look elegant, so for this rich-tasting amuse I formed the avocado into spheres by molding it inside small squares of plastic wrap. Inside each avocado sphere is a colorful and intriguing mixture of sweet crabmeat, ripe, juicy mango, red onion, bell pepper, and cucumber. The amuse is served with a drizzle of citrus vinaigrette, which makes the flavors sing like a well-rehearsed choir.
2. Peekytoe crabs are blue crabs harvested from the clear, cold waters off the coast of central Maine. They’re especially sweet, moist, and tender, but you can use any good, fresh crabmeat, such as that of the Jonah crab. The best Jonah crabs, close relatives of rock crabs, are sweet and succulent. It’s their leg meat that’s prized, while the Peekytoe and other blue crabs are esteemed for their body and leg meat.

4. Pick through the crabmeat to remove any bits of shell. Transfer to a glass or ceramic bowl, cover, and refrigerate until needed.
5. Toss the pepper, onion, cucumber, and mango with the crabmeat.
6. In a small bowl, whisk together the honey, lemon juice, and lime juice. Add to the crab mixture and toss gently. Season to taste with salt and pepper.
7. Peel the avocados. Cut each one in half and remove and discard the pit. With a sharp knife, square off each avocado half and thinly slice crosswise.
8. Cut out six 5-inch squares of plastic wrap. Fan 4 slices of avocado in the center of each square of plastic wrap so that the pieces of avocado overlap slightly. Center a small mound of the crabmeat mixture on the avocado slices. Bring the corners of the plastic wrap together and twist, forming a ball of crabmeat completely enclosed in avocado. Repeat to make 5 more balls. Chill until ready to serve.
9. To serve, unwrap the avocado-crabmeat balls and put each one on a small serving plate. Garnish each with a drizzle of citrus vinaigrette.
