## Method

1. Put the cucumber juice in a medium-sized saucepan over low heat just until warm. As soon as the juice is warm, remove from the heat. Do not let it simmer.
2. Meanwhile, fill a large bowl with cold water. Gently drop the gelatin sheets into the water, several at a time, until all are submerged. Let soften and bloom for about 5 minutes.
3. Using your hands, lift the gelatin sheets from the water and squeeze them gently between your fingers. Transfer to the cucumber juice. Stir gently until dissolved. Season to taste with salt.
4. Pour the juice into a small jelly-roll pan, or other rimmed metal pan measuring about 9 by 12 inches, and allow to cool at room temperature. Refrigerate, uncovered, for about 2 hours or until needed. When the jelly is set, cover with plastic wrap and keep refrigerated until needed.
