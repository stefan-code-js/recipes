## Method

1. Beurre blanc can be made quickly and easily by adding cold butter all at once and
2. whipping vigorously over moderately high heat. The temperature of the butter keeps the sauce cool enough to prevent it from separating. Be sure to remove it from the heat before all the butter is melted, and continue whipping. It is better to remove the sauce from the heat too
3. soon rather than too late because it can always be rewarmed slightly if necessary. Figure 9.7
4. some chefs prefer to use low heat and add the butter a little at a time in order to reduce the
