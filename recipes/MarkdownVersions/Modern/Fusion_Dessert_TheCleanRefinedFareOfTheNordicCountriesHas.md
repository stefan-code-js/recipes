Danish pastries and other Nordic bakes would be lost without the festive flavours of cinnamon, cloves, ginger, and allspice. The region’s love of pickling and preserving sees a profusion of aromatics such as dill seed and the native juniper, which also appears with game and in Finland’s sahti beer. Brown mustard is common both as a condiment and as a whole spice. LOCAL SPICE BLEND
