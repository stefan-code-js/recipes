## Method

1. Lamb, one of the best-tasting meats, is one of the most underappreciated. I love it and have long served it with tabbouleh as a main course. I discovered that the two make a lovely little amuse, too. Not surprisingly, lamb is at its best in the spring and summer, as are the tomatoes and parsley for the tabbouleh. Bulgur, the classic base for tabbouleh, is cracked and steamed dried wheat berries, and should not be confused with cracked wheat. Bulgur requires little cooking, while cracked wheat must be steamed first to soften it. Finally, the crispy garlic chips with which I garnish this are absolutely delicious and flavor the lamb as only garlic can. If you have time, fry up a lot and serve them as a snack with cocktails.
2. tablespoons finely chopped flat-leaf parsley
3. tablespoons finely diced tomato
4. cup chopped onions
5. ½ cup chopped carrots
6. ½ cup chopped celery
7. cloves garlic, sliced paper thin
8. Add the bulgur to a large pot of lightly salted boiling water. Reduce the heat and simmer the bulgur for 10 to 12 minutes or until just tender. Drain the bulgur in a colander. Allow to cool and then transfer to a small shallow bowl.
9. Add the lemon juice, parsley, tomato, and 1 tablespoon of the olive oil and toss until all the grains are coated with the dressing. Season to taste with salt and pepper. Cover and refrigerate.
10. Preheat the oven to 350°F.
11. Heat the remaining 1 tablespoon olive oil in a medium-sized, heavy-bottomed casserole or Dutch oven over medium-high heat. When the oil is almost smoking, add the lamb and sear for 8 to 12 minutes or until nicely browned on all sides.
12. While the lamb is browning, add the onions, carrots, and celery to the pan along with the thyme. Stir the vegetables occasionally.
13. Add the red wine and cook until reduced to a few tablespoons. Add enough water to cover the lamb and bring to a boil, stirring the bottom of the pan with a wooden spoon to dissolve any browned solids into the liquid.
14. Remove from the heat and cover the casserole with a tight-fitting lid. Place in the center of the oven and cook for 1 hour or until the meat is tender and almost falling off the bone. Set aside and allow to cool. When cool, refrigerate the lamb until serving. Discard the vegetables and herbs.
15. Pour the vegetable oil into a small, deep saucepan to a depth of 1½ inches. Heat over medium heat until a deep-frying thermometer registers 325°F.
16. Fry the garlic slices in the oil for 1 to 2 minutes or until they turn golden. Watch carefully because they fry very quickly. Remove from the oil with a slotted spoon to a paper towel to drain. Transfer to a flat plate, season with salt, and allow to cool completely. As they cool, the fried garlic slices will become very crispy.
17. To serve, pull or cut the meat from the bone and cut into small pieces. Place some of the tabbouleh on each of 6 small plates along with some of the lamb. Top each serving with crispy garlic.
