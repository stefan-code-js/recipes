4. 1. Beef is split first through the backbone into sides. sides are divided between the 12th and 13th ribs into forequarter and hindquarter.
5. 2. Veal and lamb are not split into sides but are divided in half into foresaddle and hindsaddle. For veal, the cut is made between the 11th and 12th ribs. Lamb, on the other hand, is split either between the 12th and 13th rib or after the 13th rib, depending on the cutting style. For more
6. information, see the charts on page 469.
7. 3. Pork carcasses are not divided in this way. they are cut directly into primal cuts (see below).
8. these are the primary divisions of quarters, foresaddles, hindsaddles, and carcasses. these cuts,

10. 2. are still large enough to allow a variety of cuts for different uses or needs
11. 3. are easier to utilize completely than quarters or halves

13. always the starting point for smaller cuts. For this reason, it will benefit you to be able to iden-
