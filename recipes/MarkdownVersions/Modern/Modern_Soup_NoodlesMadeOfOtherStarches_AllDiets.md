## Method

1. especially Morocco and Algeria. The word refers to both the grainlike product
2. and the dish made from it. After soaking,
3. couscous is steamed in the perforated top section of a double kettle called a cous-
4. stew cooks in the lower section.
5. by sprinkling water into a bowl of semo-lina flour and stirring with the hand, form-
6. ing tiny granules of dough. The granules
7. are then sifted out and dried, and the pro-cess is repeated.
8. is made in the lands at the eastern end of the Mediterranean. Israeli couscous is made from regular wheat rather than sem-olina, and it is formed into larger, spherical grains. It is typically served in place of rice.
9. 1. Measure equal parts by volume dry instant couscous
10. 2. Place the water in a saucepan and bring to a boil. Add ½ tsp (2 mL) salt and 2 tsp (10 mL) butter per pint (0.5 L) water.3. When the water boils, add the couscous and stir. Remove from the heat, cover, and let stand 5 minutes.
11. 4. Before serving, stir with a fork to break up lumps.PROCEDURE for Steaming Traditional Couscous
12. 1. Place the couscous in a bowl and add enough cold water to cover it by several inches (cm). Stir the couscous and then drain off the excess water through a fine sieve. Smooth the couscous in the bowl and let stand 15 minutes, allowing the couscous to absorb the moisture that coats it.
13. 2. With wet hands, stir and rub the grains to break up all lumps.
14. 3. Line the top of a couscousière with a double layer of cheesecloth. Place the couscous inside. If you don’t have a couscousière, select a colander that will fit over a large saucepan or similar pot. Line with cheesecloth and put the couscous in it.4. Set the couscousière top or colander over a simmering stew (or simmering water). Steam, uncovered, 20 minutes.
15. 5. Empty the couscous into a hotel pan and spread it into a flat layer. Sprinkle with a little salt and just enough water to moisten it slightly. Coat your hands with oil and stir and rub the couscous to break up all lumps. Let stand 10 minutes. At this point, if the couscous feels dry, sprinkle with a little more water and stir.
16. 6. Give the couscous a second steaming by repeating step 4.
17. 7. Turn out the finished couscous into a hotel pan or other container for service. Stir lightly to break up any lumps.
