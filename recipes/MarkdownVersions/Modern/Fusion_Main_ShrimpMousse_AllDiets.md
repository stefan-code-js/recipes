## Method

1. Set up the Thermomix and blend the raw shrimp until a smooth purée. If the shrimp are comin
2. residual liquid. As you blend, you want the shrimp to be completely broken down and smooth.Turn the Thermomix down to a lower speed and begin to emulsify in 240 mL of the cream. It’snot like making an emulsion; you can do it quickly . If the mousse seizes up in the Thermomix,
3. use a rubber spatula to clean the sides of the Thermomix jug. Once all the cream is emulsified in,
4. slowly pour in the rose oil as the mixture is spinning on a low speed. Once incorporated, seasonwith salt. While mixing the mousse, you don’t want it to heat up too much or you’ll run the risk
5. of splitting it. However, it won’t properly blend if too cold. Keep temperature in mind as you do
6. Set up a tamis lined with a fine -mesh nylon sieve and pass the mousse. Once passed, transfer to
7. a dry 1 L container over ice in the fridge to cool and set.
8. Whip the remaining 50 mL cream to medium peaks in a bowl over ice. In a separate mixing bowl,scale 100 g of the mousse. Gently fold in 25 g of the whipped cream (25% of the weight of the
9. mousse). Once incorporated, transfer 90 g to a clean and dry vacuum box lined with a
10. parchment square. Seal the vacuum box and place it into the vacuum machine, running the
11. machine up to a setting of 85%. Transfer the box immediately to the walk -in freezer and allow it
12. to sit there for 2 hours. The maximum cold temperature the vacuum boxes can stand (when vacuumed) is -18°C and -35°C (without vacuum). Once frozen, release the vacuum, and cut the
13. mousse away from the sides of the box. Working as quickly as possible using a cold cutting board, carve the mousse into approximately 8 rectangular portions, each weighing 7 to 8 g. Once cut, place the portions in a 3 L container lined with a parchment squar e and immediately
14. transfer to a - 40°C blast chiller to prevent melting. Reserve in the freezer until service.
