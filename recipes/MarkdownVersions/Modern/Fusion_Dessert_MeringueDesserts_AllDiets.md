## Method

1. 1. Pack softened ice cream into a dome-shaped mold of the desired size. Freeze solid.
2. 2. Prepare a layer of sponge cake the same size as the flat side of the mold and about ½ inch (1.5 cm) thick.
3. 3. Unmold the frozen ice cream onto the cake layer so the cake forms a base for the ice cream.
4. 4. With a spatula, cover the entire dessert with a thick layer of meringue. If desired, decorate with more meringue forced from
5. 5. Bake at 450°F (230°C) until the meringue is golden brown.
6. 6. Serve immediately.PROCEDURE for Making Baked Meringue Shells
7. 1. Beat common or Swiss meringue until stiff.
8. 2. Using a pastry bag or a spoon, form the meringue into small nest shapes on a parchment-
9. 3. Bake at 200°-225°F (about 100°C) until crisp but not browned. This will take 1-3 hours.
10. 4. Cool the shells and remove from the parchment. Be careful, as they may be fragile.
11. 5. Use in place of pastry shells for fruit tarts, fill with whipped cream and fresh strawberries or raspberries, or fill with a scoop of ice cream and garnish with chocolate or raspberry sauce. Crisp meringues with ice cream make a dessert called meringue glacée (glah say).PROCEDURE for Making Pie Topping
12. 1. Make common meringue or Swiss meringue using equal parts sugar and egg whites. Beat until just stiff.
13. 2. Spread a generous amount (2-3 cups/500-700 mL) of meringue on still-warm pies. Mound it slightly, and be sure to attach it to the edge of the crust all around. If this is not done, the meringue may slide around on the finished pie. Leave the meringue in ripples or peaks.
14. 3. Bake at 400°F (200°C) until the surface is attractively browned.
15. 4. Remove from oven and cool.
16. Japonaise (zhah po nez) meringues are used like cake layers. They may be filled and iced with light buttercream, chocolate mousse, whipped cream, or similar light icings and creams.
17. 1. Prepare 1 recipe (1 lb/500 g egg whites plus 2 lb/1 kg sugar) Swiss meringue.
18. 2. Quickly but carefully fold in 1 pound (500 g) finely chopped hazelnuts.
19. 3. With a pastry bag, form circles of the desired diameter and about ½ inch (1.5 cm) thick on parchment-lined sheet pans, as shown in Figure 36.11.
20. 4. Bake as for meringue shells.
