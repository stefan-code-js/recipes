## Method

1. Just a few fresh leaves of lemon verbena steeped in water add a lovely, deepening dimension to this juice. But, best of all, a chilly sip of this refreshing drink instantly takes you back to those hot summer days when nothing quenched your thirst better than a slice of frigid watermelon. Watermelon may be red, pink, or yellow, with or without seeds, but regardless of these minor differences, juice made from watermelon tastes exhilaratingly sweet. You need to try it. It’s one of my favorites and if you don’t try it, you’re missing out on one of the best juices you can make. Garnish it with chunks of watermelon of another color: for example, pink juice with yellow watermelon and vice versa, or scatter the shiny black pits over the plate for decoration. But however you serve it, make sure it’s ice-cold.
2. Put the water and lemon verbena leaves in a saucepan and bring to a simmer over medium-high heat. As soon as the mixture simmers, remove it from the heat and allow to steep for 15 minutes.
3. or fine-mesh sieve into a large pitcher and allow to come to room temperature.
4. or fine-mesh sieve into the pitcher of lemon verbena-infused water and stir. Stir in the lime juice. Season to taste with salt and pepper. Cover and refrigerate for at least 2 hours or until chilled.
5. Stir before pouring into small, chilled glasses for serving.
