## Method

1. Mix the juices and the honey together. Take a third of the mixture and sift in the pectin. Add it
2. to a pot on the stove and whisk while heating up the juice to a boil. Once boiled, add it back into
3. the reserved juice and stir well.
4. In the Thermomix, all the ingredients together for 4 minutes on high speed, then pass through
5. the mixture through a tamis lined with a fine -mesh nylon sieve. Reserve it in the fridge until
6. burnt. Once toasted, transfer the rose hip seeds to an electric mortar and pestle with twice their
7. weight in grapeseed oil. Allow the mortar to run for 30 minutes. Once the run has finished,
8. remove the oil, bag it in equal weight bags (no more than 700 g each), and centrifuge it to separate the oil from the sediment. Once centrifuged, strain the oil through a fine -mesh nylon
9. sieve, bag it, and rese rve it in the freezer until needed.
10. crab apple leaves, approximately 4 to 4.5 cm wide and 6.5 to 7 cm long
11. Brush the back of the crab apple leaf with the carrot and sea buckthorn pu rée. Allow the puré
12. dry at room temperature and then apply another layer. Once the second layer is dried, repea t
13. he application process again with 2 coatings of the spiced black currant purée. Once dried, pee l
14. he leaf fruit leathers off the crab apple leaves and reserve them in a covered container.
