## Method

1. sprinkled over a piece of cooked wild meat, etc. Also Greenlandic post,
2. a herb that can resemble rosemary or marjoram. Wow! The Skotsk timian
3. citrussy as the Icelandic. There are also blueberries, blackberries and
4. before. Wild berries we will use in abundance if I can get them of this quality.
5. Wild kvan (Angelica sylvestris or angelica) has an almost violent flavour.
6. We try some shoots and they taste like a cross between celery and lavage.
7. The school is a unique place and seems better than its Danish 'sister~
8. Everything is home-made, from charcuterie to sweet angelica crisps.
9. So cool that they explore their own produce.
10. Greenlandic cuisine (she gives us a copy). We spend an hour at her house,
11. where we talk about the cultural history of food in Greenland. Hurry home.
12. Denmark is playing an international football match. As usual Denmark
13. plays really badly, but it's a draw at the last minute.
14. Dinner at the school. Some of the students make and serve food for us.
15. This they do every day for each other. This is unusual for a school of its kind.
16. The Wiener schnitzel tastes good! Rene beats Mads at table tennis. ·We drink
17. a glass of wine with a couple of the locals. Unusual but good day. Goodnight .
18. Get up at 8 a.m., eat breakfast at the school's restaurant, everything home­
19. school principal, Esben Toftdahl, and Morten. We will try to set up some kind
20. of collaboration and possibly take a couple of their students a year. In return,
21. they will collect wild herbs and berries in season for us. The great problem
22. is getting them to Denmark while still fresh. Have to find a solution. Possibly
23. we could dry them. It is also a possibility to-have them transported frozen.
24. Takes around two weeks. Approximate price as freight on ferries is 50 Dkr.
