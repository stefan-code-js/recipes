## Method

1. You also get the satisfaction that comes with being a baker who is fully tuned in to
2. what you are doing and why you are doing it.
3. The recipes in this book specify water temperatures to use. I prefer warmer
4. temperatures for water and dough than some bakers do, along with a smaller amount
5. of yeast. Be careful not to use water that is too hot. Commercial yeast dies at
6. temperatures as low as about 114ºF (46ºC). When I mix flour at room temperature,
7. which is usually about 70ºF (21ºC) and water at 95ºF (35ºC) and let the mixture
8. mixing. That’s my target temperature. If it’s summer and warmer in the room (in
9. target dough temperature of 78ºF (26ºC). If you keep your flour in the refrigerator
10. or freezer, I recommend that you pull it out a day before mixing dough. All of the
11. recipes in this book assume the flour is at room temperature.
