## Method

1. of levain bread baked Monday morning
2. its best right now. Like all of my big levain loaves, the 3-kilo
3. age for several days after it’s been baked. There’s something unique about the way
4. flavors develop in big loaves. The flavors integrate and mellow with time, the
5. crumb remains soft, and the crust stays firm yet pliable. I love the variety of textures
6. in this monster. The rich, earthy, sometimes slightly bitter flavor of the crust
7. fascinates me when I think of the field of wheat it came from. The ingredients?
8. Flour, water, salt, and yeast. Bet you saw that coming.
9. the next baking day. There’s a connection to European village life, back to when
10. bread was a dietary staple. Many villages weren’t big enough to support a bakery
11. that was open every day of the week. Some villages had a communal oven that was
12. fired once a week. Bread had to last until the next bake day, so the loaves were big
13. -I mean really big. I have books with old photos of loaves that appear to be at
14. least 3 feet in diameter. Prior to the twentieth century, bread made up a significant
15. percentage of the calories in the average European diet. Back then, bread and
16. baking were important in a way that’s hard to imagine today.
