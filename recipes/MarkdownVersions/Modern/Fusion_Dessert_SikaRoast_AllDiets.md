## Ingredients

- One fistful whole black peppercorns
- Fifty g kelp
- One kg blueberries

## Method

1. We will typically use the back two -thirds of the deer -the loin, saddle, and legs. This is because
2. small and thin when all sinew is removed. Furthermore, our hunters typically aim for the heartsof the deer. Given the location of the heart, the shoulders will often get shot out or covered with blood, rendering them unusable. If you do get a decent shoulder or two in with the deer,reserve it for deer stock to make the glaze.
3. Spilt the butt, ribs, and legs from the loin, setting them aside for another application. Age the
4. saddle in a meat -aging fridge for a minimum of 7 days and a maximum of 12 days to mature.
5. Chop what meat and bones you have left over from butchering the animal into smaller pieces to
6. achieve more caramelization based on the surface area of the protein. Roast the deer at 220°C
7. (100% fan) until deeply browned -approximately 30 to 40 minutes. Once well roasted and
8. deeply caramelized, place the pieces of deer into a stockpot being careful not to add too much
9. rendered fat to the pot. Cover the roasted pieces with cold water. Bring the stock up to a
10. simmer, skimming it frequently as it does. Once well skimmed, add the black peppercorns andthe kelp. Turn the temperature down to a simmer and cook the stock for 3 to 5 hours. Once cooked, strain the mixture and transfer it to the fridge to cool overnight. The following day, skim
11. the surface of the stock while still cold, to remove any fat. Return the stock to a pot on the stov
12. nd reduce it to 33 ºBx. Once reduced, strain the stock through a fine -mesh nylon sieve and
13. reserve.
14. Blend the blueberries in a Thermomix until well puréed. F reeze the mixture in 1 L containers,
15. leaving room in the container for expansion in the freezer. Once frozen, remove the solid bricksfrom their containers and place them in cheesecloth in a shallow perforated gastro tray ove
16. eep gastro tray to catch the drippings. Keep this setup, covered, in the fridge for 2 to 3 days,
17. until completely thawed. Wring out the thawed mass for maximum extraction. Reduce the harve sted blueberry juice in a dehydrator set to 60°C until it reaches a sugar content of 80 ºBx.
18. Reserve the reduction, vacuum sealed, in the freezer until needed.
