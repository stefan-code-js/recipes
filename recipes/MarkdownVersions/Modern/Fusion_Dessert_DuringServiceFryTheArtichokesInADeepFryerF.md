## Method

1. Melt the butter and, with a small whisk, stir in the salt to dissolve. Reserve the butter warm for
2. service, stirring it before use. Also be sure the keep the side of the pot clean with a rubber spatula to prevent salt from crystallizing out of the liquid.
3. Roasted Kelp Butter
4. Wash the potatoes, keeping the skin on, and cut them in half. Fill up a 5 L container with wate
5. nd whisk in enough calcium hydroxide to bring up the water’s pH to 12. Place th e potatoes in
6. the solution and leave to soak, completely submerged, for 2 hours. Once soaked, remove the potatoes from the liquid, and wash them under cold water to rinse away the calcium hydroxide.Dry the potatoes on a towel at room temperature until dry to the touch. Transfer them to a
7. sheet of aluminum foil, seal the foil tight, and transfer the packet to a combi oven set to dry heat at 200°C (100% fan) to bake for 2.5 hours. Once out of the oven, immediately pass the potatoes through a tamis. Once the mixture is passed, it will look a bit like a doughy mash. Work
8. resemble dough. Make small balls of the potato mash weighed out to 12 g. Roll them firm like
9. dumplings and press them in a tortilla press between two parchment squares. Once pressed, cutout a circle with a 7 cm ring cutter. Keep the discs between the parchment squares for storage.Allow the tortillas to cool down to room temperature before packing them away in an airtight container until needed so that they don’t steam.
10. During service, fry the tortillas at 200°C in a deep fryer filled with grapeseed oil. After about a minute of frying, the tortillas will puff, at which point they will need to be turned over, basted,and flipped continuously for another 15 seconds or so. Once fried, remove the tortillas from theoil and drain them on a paper towel to soak up any grease. To finish, generously brush with
11. room -temperature melted roasted kelp butter on the pr esentation side of the tortilla. Add 20
12. pieces of grilled lemon thyme over the tortilla and 2 marjoram leaves on each side. Cut the
