## Method

1. Preheat the oven to 325°F.
2. Slice the head of garlic in half horizontally, across the equator, and place the halves, cut side up, on a large square of aluminum foil. Drizzle the exposed garlic cloves with 1 tablespoon of the oil and sprinkle with the thyme. Wrap the halves securely in the foil and place on a small baking tray. Roast for about 30 minutes or until tender.
3. When cool enough to handle, extract the garlic cloves by gently squeezing the halves. Put the roasted garlic cloves in a small bowl and set aside.
4. Heat the remaining 1 tablespoon oil in a small saucepan over low heat. Add the onion and celery and cook, stirring occasionally, for about 5 minutes or until the vegetables have softened without coloring.
5. Add the extracted roasted garlic, the cream, and the water. Simmer for 30 minutes over low heat. Remove the pan from the heat and set aside to cool slightly.
6. Transfer the soup to a blender and puree until smooth. Strain through a
7. or fine-mesh sieve into a small bowl. Season to taste with salt and pepper. Reheat the soup in a small saucepan over medium heat if necessary.
8. Stack the lovage leaves on a work surface. Using a sharp knife, cut the stack lengthwise into very thin strips, discarding the central ribs.
9. Serve the warm soup in small bowls or demitasse cups and garnish each serving with lovage.
