## Method

1. Cooks have paired peas and mint for generations, and I am no exception. I love the fresh, light flavors in this savory sorbet. Let it stand on its own or serve it in an almond cone.
2. In a large pot of boiling water, blanch the peas and mint leaves until the peas turn bright green. (Frozen peas cook quickly and may be done even before the water returns to a boil. To test for doneness, bite into a pea.) Drain and immediately submerge in cold water. Drain again.
3. Transfer half the peas to a blender and puree. Pass the puree through a
4. or fine-mesh sieve into a large bowl. Puree the remaining peas and strain into the same bowl. Stir in as much water as needed for a fluid consistency. Strain through a
5. or fine-mesh sieve into a large pitcher. Mix in the syrup and salt.
6. If using a conventional ice-cream machine, cover and refrigerate the mixture for at least 2 hours or until thoroughly chilled. Freeze in the ice-cream machine according to the manufacturer’s directions. Put the frozen sorbet in a chilled container, press plastic wrap against the surface, and cover. Freeze until ready to serve.
7. If using a PacoJet, pour the mixture into a PacoJet canister and freeze completely. Place the canister in the machine and spin, according to the manufacturer’s directions.
8. To serve, scoop 1-tablespoon mounds of sorbet into
