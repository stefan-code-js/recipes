## Method

1. I have always loved eating at New York restaurants, especially since Chef Bobby Flay opened his Mesa Grill. Bobby and I “grew up” together as line cooks in New York City in the early 1980s, and he remains a good friend. He does incredible things with blistered corn, including making a superb corn chowder. When I developed my own, I decided to add the corn ice to the soup. The hot and cold sensations are enticing, and if you aren’t in the habit of experimenting with temperatures, this is a good place to start. This soup can be served chilled as well as hot.

3. Heat the oil in a heavy-bottomed sauté pan or cast-iron skillet over high heat. When the oil is hot, sauté the corn kernels for 2 to 3 minutes or until charred and cooked through.
4. Combine the charred corn kernels with a small amount of the stock in a blender. With the motor running, add as much additional stock as necessary to obtain the consistency you prefer. Strain through a
5. or fine-mesh sieve into a small bowl. Season to taste with salt and pepper. Reheat the soup in a small saucepan over medium heat if necessary.
6. Serve the warm soup in small bowls or demitasse cups garnished with shavings of corn ice.
7. Juice the corn kernels in a juicer and pour the juice into a bowl. You should have about 4 cups of juice. Add the sugar and stir until dissolved. Season to taste with salt and lemon juice.
8. Put the juice into a small, shallow metal pan. Cover and freeze for about 45 minutes. Take the pan from the freezer and stir the ice with a fork to break it up. Return it to the freezer for about 3 hours longer or until frozen solid.
9. When ready to serve, scrape the frozen corn ice with a fork to garnish. Serve leftovers on their own as a palate refresher or even dessert.
