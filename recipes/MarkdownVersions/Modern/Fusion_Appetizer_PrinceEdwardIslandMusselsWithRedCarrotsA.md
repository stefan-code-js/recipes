## Method

1. I am one of those people who dream about lunch and dinner while eating breakfast, and I nearly always hope mussels will figure into one or the other. While you can use any fresh mussels for this summertime amuse, I like Prince Edward Island mussels because the waters surrounding that eastern Canadian island are clean and delightfully cool, not icy, which makes them the perfect environment for sweet, meaty mussels. Rinse and scrub the mussels gently and discard any that feel too light, which means they are only empty shells. Likewise, if the shells fall apart when you push gently on them, the mussels are dead. For this reason, buy extras; they’re a bargain anyhow. Cook the mussels until they open, and discard those that don’t open; too many people undercook mussels, so the mussels never plump up.
2. Although I have long loved steamed mussels with garlic and herbs, for this dish I serve them on a bed of steamed carrots with a creamy sauce infused with citrus and saffron. If you choose to serve this amuse in the mussel shells, be sure to scrub the shells well for a great presentation.
3. shallot, finely chopped
4. Preheat a medium-sized saucepan until hot. Put the mussels in the hot saucepan with the white wine, chopped shallot, and sprigs of thyme. Cover and steam over high heat, shaking the pan occasionally, for 3 to 5 minutes or until the mussels have opened. Remove from the heat. Discard any unopened mussels. Remove the mussels from the liquid, allow to cool, and chill thoroughly. Discard all but ¼ cup of the liquid.
5. Put the reserved liquid, the saffron, and the orange juice in a medium-sized, heavy- bottomed saucepan. Bring to a boil over medium-high heat. Reduce the heat and simmer until the sauce has reduced to ¼ cup.
6. Add the heavy cream and bring to a boil. Immediately remove the pan from the heat.
7. or fine-mesh sieve into a small bowl. Season to taste with salt and pepper and allow to cool. Cover and chill.
8. Pour about 1 inch of water into a large saucepan and bring to a boil. Layer the carrots on a steamer rack and insert the rack in the pan, over the boiling water. Cover and steam for about 5 minutes or until the carrots are tender. Remove the carrots and allow to cool. Cut the carrots into thin slices along the diagonal, transfer to a medium-sized bowl, and toss with the oil. Season to taste with salt.
9. To serve, remove the mussels from their shells and discard the shells, or save 6 of the most perfect for serving. Make a bed of a few carrot slices on a small plate or mussel shell and top with a mussel. Drizzle orange-saffron sauce over the mussel. Repeat to make 5 more servings.
