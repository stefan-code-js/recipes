## Method

1. Not everyone thinks of juicing tangerines or any of their close relatives such as clementines, satsumas, temple oranges, tangelos, and Minneolas, but all make really good, intensely flavored citrus juices. Tangerines, which should more authentically be called mandarin oranges, are easy to peel and section, which makes them and their cousins naturals for eating out of hand. But don’t stop there. Juice them! I add a little sage to boost the overall impact of the juice, but if you can’t find fresh sage, don’t use dried. It’s better to leave it out altogether.
2. in a juicer. Strain the juice through a
3. or fine-mesh sieve into a small saucepan. Add the sage and bring to a simmer over medium-high heat. Reduce the heat and simmer gently for 5 minutes. Remove from the heat and set aside to steep until the juice cools to room temperature.
4. or fine-mesh sieve into a pitcher. Add the lime juice and enough of the syrup to balance any bitterness. Cover and refrigerate for 2 hours or until chilled. Season to taste with salt and pepper.
5. Stir before pouring into small, chilled glasses for serving.
