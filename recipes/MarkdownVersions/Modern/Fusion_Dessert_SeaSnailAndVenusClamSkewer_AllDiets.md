- Smoked Butter*

## Method

1. two bags to prevent the bags from bursting, and steam at 85°C (100% fan) for 8 to 10 hours. Remove the steamed sea snails from the oven after cooking and let them cool at room temperature- do not shock in ice. Once cool, open the bags, strain the liquid from the sea
2. snails, and reserve this liquid to rewarm the skewers in service. Use a cake taster to twist the sea
3. snails out of their shells, and transfer to a cutting board to cut the snail into five sections.
4. protrudes from the middle of the snail, and the spiral liver at the very top. The last piece of the
5. snail will have the remainder of the digestive tract and guts -this can be discarded. Only use the
6. liver if the quality is good. Slice the snail pieces into approximately 0.5 cm wide pieces. Reservethe sea snail slices in a covered container in the fridge.
7. VENUS CLAMS AND VENUS CLAM COOKING LIQUID
8. Wash the Venus clams well in two changes of ice water. Leave them to soak in a third, fresh batch of ice water for 30 minutes. Once soaked, sauté the Venus clams in smoked butter and lemon thyme. When you can see the clams begin to open, then add 30 to 40 g of Danish whisky
9. to the sauté pan. Continue to cook the clams for another 20 to 30 seconds -the alcohol will not
10. 100% cook out. Remove the pan from the stove, discard whatever clams have not opened, and
11. stop the cooking process as fast as possible. Once cool, strain the clams from the broth left over
12. from cooking and reserve this liquid.
13. Remove the clams from their shells and use a sharp knife to se parate the primary yellow muscle
14. from the skirts and bellies. As you separate the yellow muscles, reserve them in a small portionof the strained cooking broth to maximize the flavor of the clams and wash them of any sand.
15. Do not discard the bellies of th e clams -place them in a sauté pan with the strained cooking
16. liquid. and continue to cook them at a light simmer. The bellies need to cook in this liquid again
17. to further impart any flavor into the liquid and to continue to cook out the alcohol from the
18. whisky. This should take 4 to 5 minutes at a light simmer. Afterward, strain the liquid through a
19. fine-mesh nylon sieve, press the solids well to maximize yield and flavor, and discard the guts.
