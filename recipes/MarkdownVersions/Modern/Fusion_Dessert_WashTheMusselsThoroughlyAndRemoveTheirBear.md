## Method

1. submerging them in ice water in the fridge for 2 hours. Once purged, fill a large sauté pan with water to a depth of 0.5 cm. Bring the water up to a boil and start cooking 12 mussels at a time.
2. Cook the mussels, moving them around, for 20 to 30 seconds, until they just barely begin to
3. open. Remove them from the pan, off to the side. Use a turning knife to carefully open the
4. mussels, making sure not to damage the cheeks of the shellfish. Be sure that the best mussel shells (of medium size and nice shape and without any blemishes) aren’t damaged or broken inhalf when you’re opening the mussels, eit her, as they’re to be used as the serving vessel for th
5. ish. Using around 6 mussels per portion, carve off the cheeks of the mussel and reserve them
6. on parchment. We want to use just the cheeks as they are the sweetest, most pure part of th e
7. ussel. Rese rve the remainder of the mussel for an alternative use or for staff food.
8. Place the portioned broth with oil into a bain -marie held at 80°C for service. Using a clean
9. parchment square, make a stack of 10 to 12 mussel cheeks, making sure that you save the largest cheeks for the bottom and top of the stack to cover any imperfect pieces in between.
10. presentation. The shell itself should have the hinge facing backward, so that the shell opens toward the guest. The stack should be stuffed toward the back of the mussel shell, and be bursting in appearance, looking fully stuffed while still leaving space (about 50%) at the front forthe caviar. Place 3 g of caviar into the empty front cavity of the shell, again, so that the servinglooks full and generous (use a bit more if necessary).
11. At the same time as the mussels are being constructed, have the serving bowl full of seaweed ina combi oven set to full steam at 80°C. The bowl should steam for 3 to 4 minutes, so that it’s warm to the touch and the seaweed is steaming hot. Once the mussels are filled for a table, line
12. them u p in a 1 L container with some folded aluminum foil so that they don’t tip over. Remove
13. squeeze the stuffed mussel shell closed, and place it into the dish. Note the position of the mussel, as it needs to open toward the guest and placed correctly in relation to the cluster ofcitrus seaweed that sits at 6 o’clock. Place the lid on quickly and snugly to keep the shell shutand to keep the heat in. Serve the dish immediately. The mussel should appear as though it’s steaming open, in front of the guest.
