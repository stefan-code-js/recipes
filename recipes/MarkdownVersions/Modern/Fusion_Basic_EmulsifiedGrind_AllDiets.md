## Method

1. capable of absorbing a good deal of moisture, and water or milk is usually added to improve the tex -
2. ture. Because of the addition of liquid to the meat purée, the resulting grind is called an emulsified grind. f or sausages that include milk, a recipe may indicate either liquid milk or water plus dried milk
3. solids. The dried milk is added at the same time as the spice mixture.
4. Because grinding meat to a smooth paste generates heat, water is added in the form of ice to
5. keep the temperature low. If liquid milk is called for, freeze it into chunks.
6. procedure is done in two stages. f irst, grind the meat and fat separately using the fine die on the
7. meat grinder. Keep the two separate and chill them after this grinding. s econd, grind the meat to a
8. smooth paste with a food chopper (buffalo chopper) or food processor. Place the lean meat in the
9. bowl of the chopper and run it a few seconds. Then add the ice and continue to grind until smooth.
10. Monitor the temperature carefully. do not allow it to rise above 50°f (10°c ). add the fat and continue
11. to grind to blend it in. c ontinue to monitor the temperature. d o not allow it to rise above 58°f (14°c ).
12. emulsified sausages are usually cooked in water after stuffing, then chilled in cold water. If they
13. are to be smoked, they are smoked first and then cooked.
14. 1. Keeping the meat and fat separate, grind them with the
15. fine die of a meat grinder, following steps 1-6 of the basic sausage-making procedure. Chill well.
16. 2. If indicated in the recipe, mix the seasonings with the lean meat. (Alternatively, add the seasonings at the same time as the ice in step 3.)
17. 3. Place the lean meat in the bowl of a food chopper or food processor. Run the chopper a few turns, then add the ice. Continue to chop to a fine paste. Do not allow the tempera-ture to rise above 50°F (10°C).
18. 4. Add the fat and continue to grind to blend it in. Continue to monitor the temperature. Do not allow it to rise above 58°F (14°C).
19. 5. Follow steps 8-12 in the procedure on page 850 to test the seasonings and stuff the casings.
20. The procedure for smoking sausages is the same as for smoking other meats (f ig. 28.3). r efer to
21. page 842 for basic information on smoking and follow the instructions in individual recipes. note in
22. 1. only cured sausages should be smoked.
23. 2. The sausages should be dried briefly before being smoked, like other smoked foods ().
24. 3. Hot smoke or cold smoke as indicated in the recipe. air-dried sausages to be eaten raw are cold
25. smoked. sausages that are sold cooked are generally hot smoked. after smoking, they are usu-ally poached to an internal temperature of 160°-165°f (71°-74°c), then cooled quickly in ice
26. COOKING Sa USa GeS
27. also popular as standalone menu items like other meats. Preparation of sausages before cooking is minimal. In most cases, sausages may be considered ready to cook-or, in the case of fully cooked
28. sausages, ready to heat. f resh raw sausages containing pork must be fully cooked before serving,
29. like other fresh pork products. If a fresh sausage contains no pork, it may be served somewhat less
30. done. r emoving it from the heat when still pink inside helps retain juices.
31. fully cooked sausages need only be heated through before serving. c ooking times, however,
32. are nearly the same as for raw sausages. In other words, the time it takes for the heat to penetrate to the center is about the same.
33. The following cooking methods are most often used for sausages.
