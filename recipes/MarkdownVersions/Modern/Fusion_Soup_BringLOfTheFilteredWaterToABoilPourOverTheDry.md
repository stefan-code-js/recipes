## Method

1. infuse for 30 minutes. Once infused, strain, add the remaining 5 L cold filtered water, and cool down in the fridge.
2. Set an oven to 200°C (100% fan). Line a cake rack with the chicken wings, and roast over a parchment -lined gastro in the oven for 30 minutes, until well caramelized. Meanwhile, add the
3. rest of the ingredients to a stockpot and bring to a boil. Once the chicken wings are roasted, addthem to the stock. Once boiling, skim the stock well and turn the heat down. Lightly simmer th
4. tock for 6 hours, occasionally skimming while it cooks. The stock should reduce to
5. approximately 20 L. After 6 hours, remove the stock from the heat and carefully strain it so as not to cloud the stock. Once strained, cool it down rapidly over ice. Once cool, remove any residual fat from that rises to the surface. Reserve in the fridge until needed; freeze any excess.
6. g celery stalks, chopped
7. Cut the bear meat into 3 cm cubes, and soak in the 1% salt brine for 1 hour. Change the salt
8. brine and soak for 1 hour more. After the 2 hours, transfer the bear meat to the bear spice brine
9. and soak overnight. The next day, strain off the brine and let the meat hang in a perforated gastro over another gastro in the fridge for 30 minutes to dry. Using the Robot -Coupe, blend the
10. brined meat until a paste forms. Slowly add the egg whites to the blending meat. Once incorporated, add the chopped celery stalk. Blend the three ingredients together well.
11. Separately in a pot, combine the cold- infused dashi and cold chicken stock. Slowly whisk in the
12. raft that you have just blended in the Robot -Coupe. Transfer the pot to the stove and slowly
13. heat while continually whisking ensuring that the raft doesn’t stick to the bottom of the pot
14. while heating. Continue to heat until the egg whites and bear meat begin to coagulate and floa
15. o the surface to form your raft. The liquid will reach a boil by the time all of the pro tein
16. coagulates completely, and your raft completely forms. Add the fava rice shoyu and the chickenwing garum to the liquid. Once the raft is afloat, turn the heat down, and allow the consommé to lightly simmer for 2 hours. After simmering, carefully ladle out your finished consommé
