## Method

1. Cover the thyme with sea lettuce to hold the herb in place and add a small bunch of the sea
2. lettuce up one side of the bowl so it can poke out the top. Continue to fill the bowl with the Irishmos s and the gaffeltang in the same manner. Place enough of the citrus seaweed nestled on top
3. so that the guest’s nose is engulfed by it when they sip from the bowl. It is there solely for aroma.
4. During service, heat the two broths in a pot on the stove until simmering, and, using an immersion blender, emulsify in the butter and cream and season with the remaining ingredientsto taste.
5. As the broth is being seasoned during service, place the seaweed bowl into a steam oven set to55°C (100% fan) to allow it and the seaweeds to warm up. Once the broth is finished and the bowl warmed, remove the bowl from the oven and pour 70 g of the broth in. Finish the dish
6. with a generous spritzing of citrus seaweed distillate and serve it to the guest just as they finish
