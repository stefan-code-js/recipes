## Method

1. The tartaric acid used in cooking is a white crystalline powder extracted from the tartar that forms on wine
2. casks in the winemaking process. It is more acidic than cream of tartar. Tartaric acid is also used to help the gelling process in certain candies like fruit jellies ( pâtes de fruit ).
3. storage tips: Store tightly sealed in a cool, dry place.
4. Citric acid, which naturally occurs in many fruits, particularly those in the citrus family, is used in the form of a crystalline white powder for cooking. This powder, also known as “sour salt,” gives jams, jellies, and certain candies a pleasantly tart flavor.
5. storage tips: Store tightly sealed in a cool, dry place.
6. Agar-agar is a plant-based thickener extracted from red algae. It is typically sold in powder or flake form and has remarkable gelling power: 1 tsp ( 4 g) of powder is enough for 4 cups ( 1 liter) of liquid. Agar-agar
7. must first be mixed with a cold liquid, and the mixture must then be brought to a boil for 1 minute, or until the agar-agar is fully dissolved. This plant-based gelatin substitute can be used to thicken jams and to set different creams, coulis, and candies. It can also be used with fruits that are not compatible with gelatin.
8. storage tips: Store tightly sealed in a cool, dry place.
9. Gelatin, available in sheet and powder form, is derived from the collagen found in the skins, hides, and bones of certain animals, particularly pigs and cows. Gelatin sheets and powder can be used interchangeably, although most professional pastry chefs prefer sheets, because the results are cleaner tasting and perfectly transparent. Gelatin is typically identified according to its setting power-called its Bloom strength-which can range from 50 to 300 . The Bloom strength of gelatin sheets is indicated by their grade, which can be
10. bronze, silver, gold, or platinum. Gold strength sheets, which generally weigh 0.1 oz. (2 g) each and have a
11. Bloom strength of between 200 and 220, are recommended for the recipes in this book.
12. times their weight of cold water and then fully dissolved in a warm, but not boiling, liquid (no hotter than 158° F/70°C). Mixtures containing gelatin should never be boiled, because they will not set properly. High
13. amounts of acidity and sugar in a given recipe can also inhibit the setting power of gelatin.
14. storage tips: Store tightly sealed in a cool, dry place.
15. Naturally occurring in fruits-such as apples, quince, citrus fruits, and currants-pectin is used in pastry making as both a thickener and gelling agent. The pectin used for cooking comes in powder form and can be divided into two broad categories: high methoxyl (HM) and low methoxyl (LM). Yellow pectin, or apple pectin, is a type of HM pectin used in fruit jellies. Once set, it has a firm texture, and it cannot be re-melted.
