## Method

### Preparation

1. 1. Collect all equipment and food supplies.
2. 2. Prepare and season the food items. Preparation may include searing or grill-marking. Chill all
3. 3. Place the food items in appropriate plastic bags designed for vacuum sealing. Add any flavor-ing ingredients indicated in the recipe. If more than one item is in a bag, space the items so that they are not touching.
4. 4. Using a chamber-type vacuum machine, evacuate the air from the bag, using the correct pres-sure setting for that item, and seal the bag.
5. 5. Chill the bag briefly.

### Cooking

6. 6. Completely submerge the bag in a controlled water bath kept at the correct cooking tempera-ture for that item (using an immersion circulator, Figure 15.12), and cook for the desired
7. time or until the interior of the food reaches the correct temperature (see Temperature Probes for Sous Vide sidebar).

### Cooking

8. 7. If the food is to be served as soon as it is cooked (typically for foods with short cooking times), remove the items from the bag, finish as directed in the recipe, and serve immediately. If the item is to be stored for later use, proceed to step 8.
9. 8. For items to be stored, remove the bag from the water bath and immediately place it in an ice bath to chill it quickly (the ice bath should be at least 50 percent ice to be most effective).
10. The items must be chilled so that their interior temperature reaches 37.4°F (3°C) in 2 hours
11. 9. Remove from the ice bath, label correctly (product name, time and date of processing, and date to be discarded), and either freeze or store in a refrigerator at 37.4°F (3°C) or lower.
12. 10. To serve, reheat in an immersion circulator until the interior temperature reaches the desired level. Remove from the bag and finish as desired. Serve at once.
