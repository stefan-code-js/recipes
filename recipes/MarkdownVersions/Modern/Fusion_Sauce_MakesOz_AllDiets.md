## Method

1. Cooking time
2. Peel the apples, cut them in half, remove the cores, and slice the apples into thin
3. matchsticks. In a large bowl, combine the apple matchsticks, 4 ½ cups (2 lb./850 g) of
4. the sugar, and the lemon juice. Cover with a sheet of parchment paper and set aside to macerate for 1 hour. Meanwhile, make the caramel by slowly melting the remaining
5. sugar in the jam pan, stirring with a wooden spoon until it becomes a medium-colored caramel. As soon as it reaches this stage, pour the hot water over the caramel to slow the cooking. Bring back to a boil, add the apple mixture to the caramel in the pan, and bring to a simmer, stirring gently. Pour this mixture into a large bowl, cover with a sheet of parchment paper, cool, and store in the refrigerator overnight.
6. The next day, pour the contents of the bowl back into the jam pan. Bring to a boil while stirring gently. Continue cooking at a rolling boil over high heat for about 5-10 minutes, stirring constantly and carefully skimming off any foam that forms on
7. the surface. Check if the jam is at setting point by drizzling a few drops onto a cold saucer: it should form a soft gel. When ready, remove from the heat and immediately fill the jars with the hot jam, screwing the lids on tightly.Ingredients2
