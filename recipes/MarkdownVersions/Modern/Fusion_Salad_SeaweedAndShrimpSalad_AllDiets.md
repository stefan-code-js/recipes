## Method

1. Set up the Thermomix and blend the raw shrimp until a smooth purée. If the shrimp are comin g
2. water as they defrost. The blended shrimp should be completely broken down and smooth. Turn
3. the Thermomix down to a lower speed and begin to emulsify in the cream. It’s not like makingan emulsion; you add the cream quickly . If the mousse seizes up in the Thermomix, use a rubber
4. spatula to clean the sides of the Thermomix jug. Once all the cream is emulsified, season the
5. base with salt. While mixing the mousse, you don’t want it to heat up too much or you’ll run therisk of splitting it, however, it won’t properly blend if it’s too cold. Keep temperature in mind asyou do this job.
6. Set up a tamis lined with a fine -mesh nylon sieve and immediately pass the mousse. Once
7. passed, transfer to a dry 1 L container over ice to rest in the fridge.
8. Whip 50 mL of extra cream to medium peaks in a bowl over ice. In a separate mixing bowl, scale100 g of the mousse. Gently fold in 25 g of the whipped cream (25% of the weight of the
9. mousse). Once incorporated, transfer 90 g of this mixture to a clean and dry vacuum box lined
10. with a parchment square. Seal the vacuum box and place it into the vacuum machine, runnin
11. e machine up to a setting of 85%. Transfer the box immediately to the walk -in freezer and
12. allow it to sit there for 2 hours. The maximum cold temperature that the vacuum boxes can stand with vacuum is -18°C, or -35°C without v acuum. Once frozen, release the vacuum, and
13. cut the mousse away from the sides of the box. Working as quickly as possible on a very cold cutting board, carve the mousse into approximately 4.5 cm cubes. Once cut, place the portionsonto upside down 1 L container lids lined with parchment, and cover with an upside -down 1 L
14. container. Immediately store the portions in a - 40°C blast chiller to prevent melting.
15. Combine all the ingredients together and reserve in a yogurt pot in the fridge.
