5. that you save the largest pieces to drape over any imperfect pieces beneath. With the reservedand cleaned shell to be used for presentation, break the hinge to separate the two halves, butkeep both pieces or ganized and grouped together so as not to mix anything up. Using an offset
6. spatula, transfer the mussel stacks to the cleaned half shells, ensuring that they take the appearance of a whole plump mussel once placed inside.
7. Working with the left- hand half s hell, season the mussels with 1 g of hazelnut oil from a pipette,
8. and a few drops of the reserved mussel cooking liquid to moisten it. Season with a few flakes ofsea salt and then shingle 9 to 10 slices of the salted hazelnuts overtop, starting from the t op of

10. For the right half shell, season the mussel stack with 1 g of Douglas fir oil from a pipette, and a
11. few grains of sea s alt. Add 10 to 12 small bunches of the pepper söl around the rim of the
12. mussel flesh and place the vinegared pine cone at the top right of the mussel stack. Add a few
