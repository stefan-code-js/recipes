## Method

1. Cooking tjme
2. Stand mixer + paddle
3. cookie cutter
4. , & • • ep1ces spice mix
5. Heat the honey to 113°F (45°C) in a saucepan and pour into the bowl of the
6. stand mixer. Add the remaining ingredients. Mix to combine (or stir by hand
7. using a spatula). Let ferment for as long as possible: at least overnight, or
8. up to 3 weeks (see Chefs' Notes).
9. Sift together the flour, baking soda, and spices. Knead the mother dough,
10. egg, browned butter, and orange zest in the bowl of the stand mixer on low
11. speed to loosen. Add the sifted dry ingredients and mix until well blended.
12. The dough will be soft and very sticky. Grease one side of two sheets of
13. parchment paper with butter. Place the dough between the buttered sides
14. of the sheets and roll it into an approximate 12-in. (30-cm) square, with a
15. thickness of l/3 in. (8 mm). Freeze the dough for 30 minutes to firm it up (it
16. will be too sticky to cut out the stars at this point).
17. Stir together the confectioners' sugar and lemon juice until smooth. Set
18. When the dough is sufficiently firm, preheat the oven to 300°F (150°C/
19. Gas Mark 2). Cut out 16 stars using the cutter and place on a baking sheet
20. lined with parchment paper. Brush with a little milk to glaze and bake for
21. As soon as you remove the stars from the oven, reduce the oven temperature
22. to 195°F (90°C/gas on lowest setting). Immediately brush the stars with the
23. lemon glaze and place in the oven for 2-3 minutes to ensure the glaze is
24. and improves their keeping quality.
