## Method

1. Begin by placing the butter in a small saucepot to melt over low heat on the stove. Using a stand
2. mixer with the whisk attachment, add the flour and salt to the mixing bowl, turn the machin
3. n, and begin incorporating the two ingredients. Weigh out the cream and egg yolks together
4. and slowly add them into the already working mixer. The fatty liquids will cause the batter to
5. clump up and it will become difficult to work. Stop the machine and push any batter stuck in the
6. whisk attachment back into the bowl. Turn the machine back on and slowly mix the ingredientstogether until they are a bit more homogeneous, about 2 minutes. Slowly add the melted
7. butter. This will cause the mixture to loosen up and become much easier to mix. Continue mixing on medium to high speed to further incorporate the ingredients and add th e remaining
8. butter. Be careful not to overwork the gluten in the batter -if it appears slightly lumpy, this is
9. okay. Remove the batter and reserve in a separate bowl.
10. Clean the mixer bowl and whisk and dry them both very well. We will whisk the egg whites next,and do not want any water getting into the meringue. Add the egg whites to the mixer bowl and
11. begin to whisk on high speed. Once foaming, start to add the granulated sugar bit by bit. Once
12. the sugar is fully incorporated, let the whites whisk till stiff peaks are formed. When they are,turn off the machine and begin to incorporate the meringue into our first batter -slowly at first.
13. Continue until fully incorporated. Once the batter has been leavened by the meringue properly,transfer it to piping bags and allow it to rest in the fridge for at least 30 minutes before cooking.
