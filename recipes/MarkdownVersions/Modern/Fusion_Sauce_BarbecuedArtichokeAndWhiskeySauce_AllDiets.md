## Method

1. Clean the artichokes carefully. Use the back of a spoon to remove the tough outer leaves by bending them directly backward until they snap off. Discard these tough, outer leaves. Using thesame technique, remove and reserve the next layer of medium leaves and reserve in a solutionof potassium metabisulphite to cook later. Remove these ideal leaves carefully -when you pull
2. them from the core, ensure that some of the choke remains at the tip of the leaf for guests toscrape off with their teeth. Do not peel the soft yellow inner leaves of the artichoke -leave
3. them on the core. Use a sharp turning knife to peel any fibrous layers from the choke and stem.Reserve the choke and stem in the metabisulphite solution to prevent oxidation.
4. artichoke). Using a small spoon or turning knife, remove the hairs of the choke and the softest,innermost leaves. We should be left with a quarter of the artichoke, with a few small- medium
5. leaves still attached to the heart. Immediately submerge the hearts in a solution of
6. metabisulphite to prevent oxidation.
7. Once all the artichokes are clean, remove the hearts from the metabisulphite solution, spreadthem on a towel to dry them a bit and s eason with salt. Transfer to a vacuum bag, seal the
8. hearts, and steam them for 5 minutes at 100°C, 100% fan. Once cooked and just tender to the
9. touch, shock them in ice water. Once cool, transfer to a container and reserve in the fridge.
10. For the reserved leaves, blanch them in the 10% brine for approximately 1 minute 20 seconds.
11. Once blanched, shock them in more 10% brine with ice. Once they are cold, place them in a
12. container lined with C -fold towels and reserve in the fridge.
13. g Roasted Kelp Salt*
14. Place the whisky into a medium pot on the stove over high heat and spark it with a torch to set
15. it aflame, then turn off the stove to stop reduction. Once the flames subside and the whisky’salcohol has burned off, melt the kelp salt in the hot liquid, sti rring to break it up. Proceed to
16. emulsify the butter into the liquid. Use cold -infused dashi as necessary to adjust the texture
17. until it’s a glaze with a consistency that can coat the back of a spoon. Reserve in a small saucepot until service.
