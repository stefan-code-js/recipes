## Method

1. When you decide to make pomegranate juice, prepare yourself for a big mess-and a joyful treat. No matter how careful you are, when you dig the tiny juice-filled seeds from the fruit and then crush them, some of the bright-red liquid will spray on the work surface and stain your fingers. Never mind. The mess is part of the fun. The cloves add a pinch of spiciness that complements the sweet-sour pomegranate juice.
2. Large, heavy, deep-red pomegranates are best. The heft signifies lots of seeds buried in the white parched membrane. The tough outer skin should be thin enough so that you can feel and practically see the pulpy seeds bursting through it. Break the fruit along scored lines, as the recipe instructs. Cutting through the skin with a knife breaks the seeds. I love thinking about how the fruit has been enjoyed since biblical times and has long been an important food in the Middle East.
3. Using a serrated knife, slice the knobs from the base of the pomegranates. Score each fruit lengthwise into quarters. Gently break apart the fruit along the scored lines. Scoop out the seed clusters and crush them in a small bowl with the back of a spoon or your hands.
4. Put the crushed fruit, along with any accumulated juices, in a fine-mesh sieve set over a small saucepan. Press down on the fruit to extract as much juice as possible.
5. Put the cloves in a small, dry skillet and toast over medium-high heat for 30 to 40 seconds or until fragrant.
6. Add the cloves to the saucepan containing the juice and bring to a simmer over medium-high heat. Reduce the heat and simmer gently for 5 minutes. Remove from the heat and set aside to steep until the juice cools to room temperature.
7. or fine-mesh sieve into a pitcher. Add the lime juice and enough of the syrup to balance any bitterness. Cover and refrigerate for 2 hours or until chilled. Season to taste with salt and pepper.
8. Stir before pouring into small, chilled glasses for serving.
