## Method

1. or you might have a recipe for a muffin batter you usually make in small quantities and mix by
2. hand. When you increase the recipe greatly, you find you have too much to do by hand. therefore,
3. you use a mixer but keep the mixing time the same. Because the mixer does the job so efficiently,
4. you overmix the batter and end up with poor-quality muffins.
5. many mixing and stirring jobs can be done only by hand. this is easy with small quantities but
6. difficult with large batches. the result is often an inferior product. in contrast, some handmade prod-
7. ucts are better if they are done in large batches. i t is hard, for example, to make a very small batch of
8. puff pastry because the dough cannot be rolled and folded properly.
9. cooking time. that this is an error can be shown by a simple example. a ssume it takes 15 minutes
10. to cook a steak in a broiler. i f you put two steaks in the broiler, it still takes 15 minutes to cook them,
11. if all other things are equal, cooking times stay the same when a recipe is converted. p roblems
12. arise, however, because all other things are not always equal. For example, a large pot of liquid takes longer to bring to a boil than a small pot. therefore, the total cooking time is longer.
13. takes longer to cool than a small pot. m eanwhile, the vegetables continue to cook in the retained
14. heat during the cooling. i n order to avoid overcooking, you may need to undercook the large
15. in cases where the cooking time must be increased, you might find you must increase the
16. amount of herbs and spices. this is because the flavors are volatile (), and more flavor is lost
17. because of the increased cooking time. ( another answer to this problem is to add the spices later.)
18. changing recipe sizes can affect not only cooking times but also mixing times. the best way to
19. avoid this problem is to rely not on printed cooking and mixing times but on your own judgment and skills to tell you when a product is properly cooked or properly blended.
20. many recipes have flaws, either in the quantities or types of ingredients or in the cooking proce -
21. dures. When the item is made in small quantities, these flaws may not be noticeable, or the cook
22. may almost unconsciously or automatically make adjustments during production. When the recipe
23. is multiplied, however, the flaws may suddenly become apparent and the product quality lower. the
24. only solution here is to carefully test recipes and to have a good understanding of basic cooking
25. Food-service operations are businesses. this means someone in the operation must worry about
26. budgets, cost accounting, bills, and profits. u sually this is the job of the manager, while the cook
27. cooks have a great deal of responsibility for food cost controls, however. they must always be
28. conscious of accurate measurement, portion control, and careful processing, cooking, and handling of foods to avoid excess trimming loss, shrinkage, and waste.
29. and expenses, and so on. We cannot deal with these subjects here, as this is a book about food prep -
30. aration. But you may encounter them later in your studies or in your career.
31. regardless, every cook should understand three areas of cost accounting: doing yield analyses,
32. calculating raw food cost or portion cost, and using food cost percentages.
33. an individual operation’s food cost percentage is usually determined by the budget. the chef is
34. interested in this figure because it tells him or her whether the menu prices and the costs for each item are in line.
