## Method

1. and place the tamis on a hanging rack above the barbecue. Light some charcoal and add a bit ofbirchwood to smolder with the lit charcoal. Allow the peppercorns t o slowly smoke and slowly
2. cook from the radiant heat coming from the barbecue. The peppercorns initially will be black incolor. After the slow smoking and cooking process, they should turn a reddish -brown color. This
3. process should take 2 to 3 hours. Thes e should be smoked twice a week. Once smoked, transfer
4. to an airtight container. The peppers will be roughly chopped just before service.
5. SLICED MUSHROOMS
6. The variety of mushroom will more than likely change throughout the course of the season. Wild
7. mushrooms are very weather dependent. One day they are bountiful; the next, they are nonexistent. We will potentially even need to use jarred mushrooms at one point. Having saidall this, take care w ith the mushrooms to ensure that we waste nothing.
8. We are looking to use smaller ceps, or any mushroom that is denser in texture. Use a small brush to clean the cep very well. Using a very sharp knife, cut two opposite sides of the ceps. Wewant two clean faces on the mushroom for the sake of cooking with a maximized surface area.The mushroom itself should be 1.5 to 2 cm thick. Once sliced, store the mushroom in a 1 L container with a damp C -fold towel below it and another above it to ensure that the mus hroo
9. oesn’t dry out. Reserve in the fridge until service.
10. MUSHROOM COOKING GLAZE
11. Combine all the ingredients in a saucepot and bring to a boil to emulsify. Simmer the glaze over
12. low heat until it splits out again, approximately 30 minutes. Once it splits again, strain the glaze
13. through a conical strainer. Reserve the glaze in a pot on the barbecue for service.
