## Method

1. Crack open the cardamom pods. Toss them in with the cream and sonicate the mixture over ice
2. at 30% amplitude, stirring frequently, for 5 minutes. Once sonicated, strain the cream, and
3. discard the cardamom pods. From there, place the sugar, salt, glucose, and 300 mL of th e
4. infused cream in a pot. Cook the mixture until it reaches 108°C on a candy thermometer. Whileit’s cooking, melt the butter in another pot on the side. Once the caramel is up to temperature,add the melted butter and the vinegar. Return the mixture to th e heat and cook it again until it
5. reaches 112°C. Once up to temperature, remove it from the heat and incorporate the licorice syrup. Allow the mixture to cool down to 60°C.
6. Heat up the remaining 75 mL infused cream in a small pot on the stove. Once warmed , mix it
7. into the toffee mixture. Allow it to cool down to room temperature. Once cool, Place the mixture into a piping bag, and evenly pipe the toffee into the loose sea star shells. Once filled, transfer the sea star to the freezer to firm up a bit. Remove it to shape its arms while the caramel is still pliable and flexible. From there, transfer the sea star leather- side up to a Silpat -
8. lined tray and place it in the blast freezer. Reserve these sea star bases until you are ready to build the complete sea star.
9. Mix the milk powder and confectioners’ sugar together until well blended. Separately, melt th
10. ocoa butter together with the soy lecithin until the soy lecithin dissolves. From there, pour the
11. cocoa butter mixture into an electric mortar and pestle, and start up the machine. One teaspoonat a time, add the confectioners’ sugar and milk powder mix. Ensure that the powders are fullydissolved in the spinning mixture before adding the next spoonful of powder. Once fully
12. incorporated, allow the machine to run for at least two hours. After 2 hours, remove the mix
13. from the machine and dissolve in the saffron powder. Transfer the mixture to a double boiler and bring the temperature up to 50°C. Once at temperature, transfer the glaze to a bowl over an ice bath and bring the temperature down to 26°C while stirring to keep the temperature even.
