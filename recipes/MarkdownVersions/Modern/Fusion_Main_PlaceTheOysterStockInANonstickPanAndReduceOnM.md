## Method

1. Place the oyster stock in a nonstick pan and reduce on medium heat. As you reduce the stock,
2. skim any scum that rises to the surface. When the stock reduces by 75%, add the roasted kelp salt and the peaso reduction , and further reduce until you get approximately 35 g of final
3. product. The texture should be like a soft caramel. Transfer the caramel to a container and reserve in the fridge until service.
4. Bloom the gelatin in ice water. Place all remaining ingredients in a pot and bring to a boil. Once
5. bloomed, whisk the gelatin into the boiling liquid. In an appropriately sized container, set the ge
6. the fridge. Once set, transfer the gel to a piping bag. Reserve in the fridge.
7. After shucking the oysters, wash the shells well. Place the shells in an appropriately sized
8. container, pour over enough quince juice to cover, and cycle through the vacuum machine once.
9. This is done to remove any fishiness from the oyster shell as it will be the vessel for the ice
10. cream. You should only have to vacuum a new shell once or twice to remove the fishiness. Reserve in the freezer.
11. Place a pacojet container of the quince amazake ice cream in a blast chiller for at least 1 hour
12. before spinning. Spin the ice cream in the paco jet, transfer the spun ice cream to a piping bag,
13. and let it rest in the freezer for 15 minutes to set. Place your marinated oyster shells in a
14. container of ice, and carefully pipe in 25 g of ice cream. Use the back of a teaspoon to smooth
15. out the surface of the ice cream. The ice cream should not go to the edge of the oyster shell ;
16. there should be a bit of space -almost as if the ice cream were the oyster itself. Transfer the
17. oyster shells with ice cream to a 1 liter container with crumpled up tin foil in it to make sure theshells sit flat. Freeze the oyster shells and ice cream for at least 2 hours.
