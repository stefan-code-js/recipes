## Method

1. Fennel is a wonderful vegetable, available from late fall through the winter, but it’s not always used to its best advantage. My friend Chef Mario Batali, chef-owner of Babbo Ristorante e Enoteca, in New York City, cooked for me one night and served a delicious caramelized fennel salad, which, as soon as I tasted it, sent me hurrying back to the Tru kitchen to create my own version. Fennel’s intrinsic nuttiness is highlighted when it’s caramelized. I serve it with a little celery-root puree, which heightens the earthiness of the dish while giving it great depth of flavor. Celery root, which is common in Europe, is becoming increasingly popular here.
2. ¼ cup chopped flat-leaf parsley
3. Remove the stems and leaves from the celery root. Peel and coarsely dice the flesh.
4. Combine the water, cream, and celery root in a small saucepan. Bring to a simmer over medium-high heat. Reduce the heat and simmer gently for 15 to 25 minutes or until the celery root is tender. Remove from the heat and allow to cool slightly.
5. Transfer the mixture to a blender and puree until smooth. Strain through a
6. or fine-mesh sieve into a small bowl. Season to taste with salt and pepper. Set aside to cool.
7. Cut the stems and fronds off the fennel and discard the fronds. Cut the bulb in half lengthwise. Remove and discard the core at the base of each half and very thinly slice the halves.
8. Heat 1 tablespoon of the oil in a small sauté pan over medium heat. Add a small amount of the fennel and cook, stirring occasionally, for 10 to 15 minutes or until it is a deep golden brown and softened. Season to taste with salt and pepper. Remove the fennel from the pan and let cool. Cook the remaining fennel in small batches, adding more oil each time.
9. Put the fennel in a medium-sized bowl and toss with the parsley and enough of the remaining olive oil to coat.
10. To serve, spread a spoonful of the celery-root puree on a small plate. Top with some of the fennel salad. Repeat to make 5 more servings.
