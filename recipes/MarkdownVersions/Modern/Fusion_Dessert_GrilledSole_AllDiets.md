## Method

1. Melt the butter and, with a small whisk, stir in the salt to dissolve. Reserve the butter warm for
2. service, stirring it before use. Also be sure the keep the side of the pot clean with a rubber spatula to prevent salt from crystallizing out of the liquid.
3. Roasted Kelp Butter
4. Scale the sole, then scrape the skin twice with the back of a knife. Remove the gills, guts, and roe and age the sole by hanging it in the fridge for 2 days.
5. Once aged, tie 2 of the black currant wood branches at one end with butcher’s twine. Repeat this with the other two sets of 2 branches. Nestle the aged sole inside of the branches and tie
6. the open ends to secure the sole between the branches. The black currant wood should be lon
7. nough to rest on a yakitori without a grate (about 25 cm). Temper the sole out of the fridge fo r
8. inimum of 1 hour. Grill the fish over gently glowing coals. Glaze the fish liberally with the
9. roasted kelp butter continuously as you cook it over the coals, so you are always generating some smoke, thereby flavoring the fish. Cook the sole until just warm when tested with a cake
10. tester, approximately 10 to 15 minutes. In the last 5 minutes of cooking, throw a few Douglas
11. ranches over the coals to smoke the fish for the final minutes of cooking. Once cooked, leav e
12. he fish to rest in a warm spot for 5 minutes.
13. TO SERVE
14. Roasted Kelp Butter
15. Remove the black currant wood from the fish. Peel off the top, dark skin, however, leave the white skin to serve. Use a very sharp knife to remove the fish from the bone to yield 4 fillets tocut portions from. Cut the fish into approximately 25 to 30 g portions. Place a portion on a black
16. currant wood mat in a bowl, glaze the fish once more with warm roasted kelp butter, and season it with salt. Serve immediately.
