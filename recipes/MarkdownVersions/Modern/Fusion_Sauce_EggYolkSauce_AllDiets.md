## Method

1. them in the water bath to cook for 22 minutes. With the remaining 10 eggs (the raw ones), crack
2. them and separate the yolks from the whites, being sure to keep the yolks whole. Place the raw
3. yolks in a plastic container and cover them with the beef and chicken wing garum mixture. Allowthese egg yolks to cure in the garum for 20 minutes.
4. Remove the cured raw egg yolks from the garum and set them aside, covered. The timer shouldnow be done on the eggs cooking in the water bath. Remove them from the circulator and shockthem in ice water. Once cooled, crack them, and separate the yolks from the whites (you may
5. need to rinse them gently under cold w ater to wash off any egg white still adhering to the yolk).
6. Place them in the same beef and chicken wing garum and cure these cooked eggs for 20
7. minutes. Once finished, remove the yolks, and transfer them to a mixing bowl. Add the cured
8. raw yolks but be su re to reserve a few of the raw cured eggs and the cooked cured eggs in cas
9. ou need to adjust the consistency. With a whisk, gently mix them (you are not trying to whip
10. them, just mix them thoroughly) and season the resulting thick liquid with smoked butt er,
11. smoked butter whey, potentially some of the garum mixture, and a bit of salt.
12. Pass the seasoned egg yolk sauce through a tamis lined with a fine -mesh nylon sieve, and cycle
13. without stopping the machine. Once compressed, transfer the finished egg yolk sauce to squeeze bottles and reserve in the fridge until service.
14. Defrost the roe the night before. The following day, remove the defrosted roe from the bucket it
15. came in, and wash it in cold, filtered water. Using a rubber spatula, gently stir the roe through the water to wash some of the salinity from it, but not so vigorously as to b reak the roe. Do this
16. process for 2 minutes, then strain the roe through a fine -mesh nylon sieve. Maneuver the roe
17. with a rubber spatula in the fine -mesh nylon sieve to ensure maximum drainage of the water.
18. Do not press the roe. Once strained, gently transfer the roe to a gray towel -lined gastro over ice.
19. Reserve, covered, in the fridge until portioning. Portion the roe into dry yogurt pots at 22 g perportion. Reserve in the fridge until service.
