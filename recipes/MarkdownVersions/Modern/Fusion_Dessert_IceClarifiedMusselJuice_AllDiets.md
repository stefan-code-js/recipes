## Method

1. Wash the mussels of any dirt, scrubbing if necessary, and removing any beards where visible. Heat a large rondeau on the stove. Add the mussels and the water in order to flash boil and steam. Cover the pot with a lid and agitate the pot to stir the mussels around. Lower the heat
2. and allow the mussels to open and cook, r eleasing their juices. Once cooked, pull the pot off th
3. tove, still covered, and allow it to cool. Once cool, strain off all the liquid. Freeze it in a covered
4. container. Once frozen, remove the mussel juice from its container and allow it to hang in a
5. ridge until completely thawed. Once thawed, vacuum seal and reserve in the freezer until
6. Warm the mussel juice, transfer it to a 1 L container, and place it in a dehydrator to reduce to a
7. iscous paste. The viscosity you need to achieve by reducing the liquid in the dehydrator is quite
8. particular. It needs to be thin enough to work with and spread, but thic k enough so that when i t
9. spread thin, surface tension doesn’t pull it back together forming holes on the mat. Once this
10. viscosity is achieved, spread the reduced mussel juice onto a Silpat and return the reduction to adehydrator and dry at 40°C until a bit more than halfway dried, then remove it from the
11. dehydrator, peel it back off the Silpat, and return it to the dehydrator to dry it until completelycrisp. Reserve the mussel caramel in a dry airtight container.
12. Roasted K elp Salt*
13. Whip th e cream t o soft p eaks. B reak th e sea cucumber c risp i nto 5 p ieces, roughly 2 x 2 cm in
14. area. Do the same to 3 shards of mussel caramel. Break the sea cucumber gonads into 5 or 6
15. slightly larger shards and brush them with horseradish oil. Place a dollop of whipped cream in
16. the center of a small bowl over ice. Place roughly 6 pieces of roasted kelp salt over the
17. cream. Arrange all the gonads, the caramel, and the crisp in an attractive, swept-back, and
18. shingled manner. Season the dish with 2 drops of oyster garum and 2 drops of horseradish
19. juice. Serve.
