## Method

1. LARDO SPICE MIX
2. Blend all the ingredients together in a spice grinder until finely powdered, then reserve.
3. Lardo Spice Mix
4. Clean the fat of any meat or silver skin. Liberally season it with salt to coat all surfaces. Place the
5. back fat in a gastro on a rack in the fridge to cure overnight in the salt coating. The following day, brush away the excess salt, and cold smoke it for about 4 hours over hay. Once smoked, rub
6. it all over in the lardo spice mix, and transfer it, uncovered, to a rack in the fridge to age for at least 2 weeks. Once dried in and aged, vacuum seal the fat and store it in the freezer until needed. During prep, using a sharp mandolin, slice the lardo into rectangular planks about 2 mm
7. thick. The lardo should not curl; it should be flat. Once sliced, lay out the lardo on parchment
8. squares and rese rve in a covered container in the fridge.
9. Remove the stems from the peppers. Roast the peppers in a parchment- lined gastro at 200°C
10. (100% fan) for 25 minutes. Once roasted, while wearing gloves, carefully crush the roasted
11. peppers to release the pepper juice. Be careful, as the peppers will be quite hot. Hang the
12. roasted peppers over a fine -mesh nylon sieve for about 4 hours with a weight on top to press
13. out the juices. Once hung, mix the resulting pepper juice with 5% red pepper tamari, transfer to1 L containers, and reduce by half in a dehydrator set to 60°C. The resulting reduction should be20 ºBx. Once reduced, reserve in the fridge until needed.
