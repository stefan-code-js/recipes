## Method

1. service. It’s extremely important to mix the emulsion well before using. Reserve any excess
2. oyster liquor to adjust the emulsion in service, if necessary.
3. pieces Roasted Kelp Salt *
4. Set an oven to 175°C (0% fan). Line a flat metal tray with parchment paper and retrieve your
5. room -temperature éclair dough. Pipe 7 cm éclairs on the tray, leaving approximately 4 cm of
6. space between each éclair -you will be able to fit approximately 12 per tray. Bake the éclairs for
7. to 35 minutes. When finished, open the door to the oven but leave the éclairs in the oven tocool for 10 minutes. Once cool, remove the éclairs from the oven and leave them to rest for anadditional 2 minutes, until room temperature.
8. In a mixing bowl, whip the cream to stiff peaks and transfer to a piping bag fitted with a long, skinny nozzle. Pipe 3 dots of the cream into the éclair through the bottom -the éclair should
9. only be about half full of cream, we do not want to fill the entire choux. Flip the éclair over and
10. roll the top 30% of it through the oyster emulsion. Add one piece of roasted kelp salt to eitherend of the éclair, resting on the oyster emulsion. Add a 5 g scoop of caviar to the middle of t he
11. éclair, on top of the oyster emulsion. Serve immediately.
