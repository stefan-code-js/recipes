## Method

1. Bring a pot of unsalted water to a boil. Lightly score an “x” into the base of the tomatoes. Quickly blanch and shock the tomatoes. Remove them from the ice water and peel off their skin.Dry them off and brush them with koji oil. Place the marinated tomatoes onto dehydrator trays,add a drop of honey to each one, and dry them at 60°C in a dehydrator for approximately 8 hours (depending on size). Turn the tomatoes every 2 hours to allow for even dehydration. Theyshould be just slightly less chewy than a good sultana raisin. Reserve the tomatoes at room
