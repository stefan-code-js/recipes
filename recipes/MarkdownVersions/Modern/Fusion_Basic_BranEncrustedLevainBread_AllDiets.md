## Method

1. Wheat germ and bran are expelled from the wheat kernel in the modern milling process,
2. leaving just the endosperm, which is milled to make white flour. Bran takes up about 14
3. percent of the kernel’s weight, and germ accounts for 2.5 to 3 percent of the weight. This
4. recipe folds the germ back in and coats the loaf with a small amount of bran. If you want
5. to use more germ in the dough, go for it; up to about 100 grams should be fine. Although I
6. crumb. The bran coating, which can tolerate a long baking time, gives the crust a nice
7. crisp crunch and a roasted nut flavor. The bran does have a habit of scattering when you
8. slice the bread-c’est la vie. A handful of bran goes into the proofing baskets and will
9. adhere to the loaves when you remove them for baking.
10. THIS RECIPE MAKES 2 LOAVES, EACH ABOUT 1½ POUNDS.
11. Feed the levain at 8 a.m., mix the final dough at 3 p.m., shape
12. into loaves at 8 p.m., proof the loaves in the refrigerator overnight, and
13. bake around 8 to 10 a.m. the next morning.
