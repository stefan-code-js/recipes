## Method

1. Ther momix. Once it comes together, proceed to add the oils until the mixture emulsifies like a
2. mayonnaise. Do not pass it. Reserve the paste in a piping bag in the fridge until needed.
3. g Chopped P arsley
4. g Benedict Hvid Kloster cheese rind, chopped
5. Make a flour slurry by mixing equal parts water and flour together and reserve in a piping bag.
6. Place 1 caramelized milk skin punch- out onto your c utting board with the caramelized side
7. down. Pipe a small ring of the flour slurry around the edge of the milk skin. Place 6 g of the chopped parsley onto the bottom of the milk skin inside the slurry ring. Lay 5 lemon thyme leaves over the parsley. Take 9 g of Benedict Hvid Kloster cheese, and form the soft cheese into
8. a disc. Take 1 g of the rind of the cheese and chop it. Place the disc of cheese in the center of th
9. ilk skin over the parsley and place the chopped rind over the cheese. Lay the other
10. caramelized milk skin over the top with its caramelized side facing up, and seal it around the edge. The pockets need to be made at least 1 hour before service as the slurry needs time to set.
11. g Preserve Truffles*
12. Just before service, slice the preserved truffles on a mandolin at a thickness of no more than 1mm. Reserve the sliced truffles, 6 g per portion, in between parchment paper in a container.
13. Heat the grapeseed oil in a rondeau to 200°C and fry the milk skin while basting it with hot oil
14. for 25 to 30 seconds. Remove the pocket and allow it drain on paper towel on both sides. Pipethe truffle purée in over the fried pocket in a spiral, starting from the cent er and winding out to
15. the rim, to serve as a glue for the sliced truffles that will garnish the serving. Now shingle the 6 gof sliced preserved truffles to cover the fried milk skin pocket. Season the top with salt and h
16. pipette of cep oil. Serve imm ediately.
