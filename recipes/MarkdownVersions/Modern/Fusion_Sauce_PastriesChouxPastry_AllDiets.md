2. the bowl of the stand mixer and beat with the paddle beater for 10 minutes to cool
3. the mixture. Roll out between 2 sheets of parchment paper about ½ in. ( 1 cm) thick
4. and cut into ¼-in. ( 5-mm) cubes.
5. Prepare the vanilla mix by freezing the vanilla bean and then grinding it in the food
6. processor. Add the sacheted vanilla. Mix the water with the gelatin, set in the refrig -
7. erator, and then cut into cubes. Mix the cream, glucose, 0 .01 oz. ( 0.2 g) of the vanilla
8. mix (set aside the rest for the vanilla paste), salt, and grated tonka bean together. Bring to a boil and infuse for 10 minutes. Make a caramel with the sugar and then stop
9. the cooking process with the hot cream. Bring the caramel cream to a boil, add the gelatin cubes, strain through a fine-mesh sieve, and blend. Set aside in the refrigerator.
10. Warm the syrup to 59°F (15°C ) and mix in the food colorings. Pour this coloring
11. into the bowl of the stand mixer fitted with the dough hook and combine with the almond paste. Add the hot melted cocoa butter and invert sugar and mix well. Roll out between 2 sheets of acetate to a thickness of
12. in. (2 mm). Using the pastry cut -
13. ter, cut out 15 disks. Press the disks into the relief mold to give them a ruffled shape.
14. Preheat the oven to 425°F (220°C /Gas mark 7 ). Make the choux pastry (see technique
15. ) . Using a pastry bag with a plain tip, pipe 15 large and 15 small puffs. Top the
16. large ones with a craquelin disk and sprinkle the dextrose and cocoa butter mix over
17. the small balls. Bake for about 20 minutes.
18. Blend all the ingredients until the mixture forms a smooth paste.
19. Mix the water with the gelatin, allow to set in the refrigerator , then cut into cubes. In a saucepan, make a dry caramel with the sugar. At the same time, heat the milk with the vanilla paste. Deglaze the caramel with the hot milk strained through a fine-mesh sieve. In a separate bowl, beat the egg yolks, sugar, and cornstarch until pale and thick. Whisk the caramel milk into the yolk mixture, pour back into the pan, and bring to a boil. Add the salt, stir in the gelatin, and lastly the butter. Cover in plastic wrap and cool quickly in a shallow container in the refrigerator. When chilled, whisk the caramel crémeux to soften it and then fold in the whipped cream.
20. and cool on a rack. Using a pastry bag with a plain tip, fill all the puffs with caramel crémeux. Top the larger puffs with disks of almond paste, shaping them so they fit snugly over the puffs without misshaping them. Trim the rounded side of the small puffs and sit on top of the larger ones, sticking them in place with a little melted Dulcey chocolate. Whip the caramel Chantilly cream until stiff and, using the pastry bag with a fluted tip, pipe a rosette of cream on top of each puff. Decorate each one with a fudge cube.Makes 15
