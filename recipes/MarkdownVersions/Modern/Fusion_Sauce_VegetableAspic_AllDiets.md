## Method

1. Put the vegetable stock in a medium-sized saucepan and bring to a boil. As soon as the stock comes to a boil, remove from the heat.
2. Meanwhile, fill a large bowl with cold water. Gently drop the gelatin sheets into the water, several at a time, until all are submerged. Let soften and bloom for about 5 minutes.
3. Using your hands, lift the gelatin sheets from the water and squeeze them gently between your fingers. Transfer to the hot vegetable stock. Stir gently until dissolved. Season to taste with salt. Allow to cool to room temperature.
4. Transfer to a covered container and refrigerate until needed.
