## Method

1. Because I particularly like carrot and orange together, I use a blood orange reduction to garnish these amuse, but you can use any reduction you like. You can even make the flan with asparagus or broccoli instead of carrots. If you have a blowtorch, sprinkle sugar on top of the cutout shapes and caramelize them for the crème brûlée effect. Doing so adds another dimension that will surely impress your guests.
2. Nonstick cooking spray
3. Carrot sprouts, for garnishing
4. Put 2¼ cups of the blood orange juice in a small, heavy-bottomed saucepan and bring to a boil over medium-high heat. Reduce the heat and simmer for about 25 minutes or until the juice is reduced to ¾ cup.
5. or fine-mesh sieve into a small bowl. Cover and refrigerate until needed.
6. Put the carrot juice in a small, heavy-bottomed saucepan and bring to a boil over medium-high heat. Reduce the heat and simmer for about 15 minutes or until the juice is reduced by half. Remove from the heat.
7. Put all but 3 tablespoons of the heavy cream in a large saucepan with the grated carrots, the 2 tablespoons granulated sugar, the carrot reduction, and the blood orange reduction and bring to a boil. As soon as the mixture comes to a boil, remove from the heat.
8. Meanwhile, fill a large bowl with cold water. Gently drop the gelatin sheets into the water, several at a time, until all are submerged. Let soften and bloom for about 5 minutes.
9. Transfer the carrot mixture to a blender and puree. You will have to do this in batches. Strain each batch through a
10. or fine-mesh sieve into a large bowl.
11. Using your hands, lift the gelatin sheets from the water and squeeze them gently between your fingers. Transfer the sheets to the still-warm carrot mixture and stir gently until dissolved. Allow to cool to room temperature.
12. In a chilled bowl with a chilled whisk, whip the remaining 3 tablespoons cream until firm peaks form. Fold the whipped cream into the carrot mixture.
13. Lightly coat a small jelly-roll pan, or other rimmed metal pan measuring about 9 by 12 inches, with nonstick cooking spray. Spoon in the carrot mixture. Smooth the surface and refrigerate, uncovered, for about 4 hours or until set. When the flan has set, cover with plastic wrap and keep refrigerated until ready to use.
14. or fine-mesh sieve into a small, heavy-bottomed saucepan and bring to a boil over medium-high heat. Reduce the heat and simmer for about 45 minutes or until reduced to ¼ cup. Remove from the heat and allow to cool. Cover and refrigerate until needed.
15. Using a small cookie cutter, cut the carrot flan into shapes. Gently lift the shapes from the flan with a small offset spatula and dip in the coarse sugar. Move a blowtorch over the cutout shapes for a few seconds or until the sugar caramelizes, if desired. Be careful not to hold the torch in one spot or too close, or you could melt the flan.
16. To serve, put 2 or 3 of the shapes on a small plate and drizzle with a little blood orange reduction. Garnish with carrot sprouts. Repeat to make 9 more servings.
