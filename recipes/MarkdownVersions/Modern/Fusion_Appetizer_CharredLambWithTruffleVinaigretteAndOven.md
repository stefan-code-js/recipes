## Ingredients

- CHARRED LAMB WITH TRUFFLE VINAIGRETTE AND OVEN-DRIED TOMATOES
- Three pound Roma tomatoes (about 1 ) or other good, firm, ripe tomatoes

- One tablespoon olive oil
- One teaspoon chopped flat-leaf parsley
- One teaspoon chopped fresh basil
- One tablespoon sweet Hungarian paprika
- One teaspoon freshly ground black pepper
- Six ounces loin of lamb, cut with the grain

## Method

1. Preheat the oven to 250°F.
2. Core and split the tomatoes in half lengthwise. Transfer to a medium-sized bowl and gently toss with the garlic, oil, parsley, and basil.
3. Lift the tomatoes from the bowl and place, cut side up, on a baking sheet. Roast for 3 hours. They will be somewhat dried but still slightly plump. Cool to room temperature.
4. Combine the paprika and pepper in a small bowl and mix well. Coat the lamb with the spice mixture and then season to taste with salt.
5. Heat a lightly greased cast-iron skillet over high heat until almost smoking. Cook the lamb for about 1 minute on each side or until well browned. Transfer the lamb to a plate and allow to rest for 5 minutes.
6. To serve, slice the lamb into 6 equal portions. Cut each oven-dried tomato half lengthwise in half again. Arrange 2 pieces of tomato on a small plate. Spoon some of the truffle vinaigrette alongside the tomatoes and place a slice of lamb over the vinaigrette. Repeat to make 5 more servings.
