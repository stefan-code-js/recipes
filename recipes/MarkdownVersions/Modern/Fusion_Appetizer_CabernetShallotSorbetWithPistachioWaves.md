## Method

1. Heat the oil in a small sauté pan over medium-low heat. Add the shallot and cook, stirring frequently, for about 5 minutes or until the shallot is nicely browned. Add ½ cup of the wine and bring to a boil, stirring the bottom of the pan with a wooden spoon to deglaze. Remove from the heat.
2. Put the remaining wine in a large saucepan along with the shallot-wine mixture and bring to a boil over high heat. Reduce the heat and simmer for 40 to 50 minutes or until the wine is reduced by half, or to about 1½ cups. Remove from the heat and stir in the simple syrup and glucose or corn syrup. Allow to cool to room temperature. Strain through a
3. or fine-mesh sieve into a large bowl, reserving the shallot.
4. Return the shallot to the wine and pour the mixture into a pitcher or bowl.
5. If using a conventional ice-cream machine, cover and refrigerate the mixture for at least 2 hours or until thoroughly chilled. Freeze in the ice-cream machine according to the manufacturer’s directions. Put the frozen sorbet in a chilled container, press plastic wrap against the surface, and cover. Freeze until ready to serve.
6. If using a PacoJet, pour the mixture into a PacoJet canister and freeze completely. Place the canister in the machine and spin, according to the manufacturer’s directions.
7. To serve, place 1 pistachio wave on a small plate, seasoned side up, and scoop a tiny mound of sorbet into the central indentation. Repeat to make 5 more servings.
