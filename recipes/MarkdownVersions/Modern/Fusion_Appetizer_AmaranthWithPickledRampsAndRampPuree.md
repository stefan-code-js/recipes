## Method

1. This amuse evolved because I was looking for a way to use ramps, one of springtime’s treats. Also called wild leeks, ramps resemble scallions and grow wild in the northern tier of the country. They taste at once like onions and garlic, and while their flavor is a little stronger than either, they can be served raw or cooked. I like them pickled, too. Ramps appear in farmers’ and specialty markets in the early springtime and can be found as late as June. Use them soon after buying, but if you must, store them in the refrigerator wrapped in a cloth.
2. I pair flavorful ramps with amaranth, an ancient grain used extensively by the Aztecs. The tiny golden grain has a crunchy texture and an unmistakably peppery flavor that begs for the company of oniony ramps. It’s wonderful to cook with little-known grains such as amaranth, kamut, and spelt. They provide lovely flavor while delivering a good dose of protein and vitamins. Amaranth has been around for centuries, and while it may not be mass produced in the way wheat and corn are, it’s not particularly hard to find in supermarkets and natural food stores if you keep your eyes open. I really like the idea that it has been nurturing people for so long-and what better introduction than in a tasty amuse?
3. cups chopped ramp leaves
4. Put the ramp leaves and the water in a heavy-duty blender or food processor and puree. With the motor running, add the grapeseed oil and blend until emulsified. Season with salt and pepper as you work. Strain through a
5. or fine-mesh sieve into a small bowl. Taste and adjust seasoning. Cover with plastic wrap and chill.
6. Bring a medium-sized saucepan of water to a boil over high heat. Add the amaranth and cook for 8 to 10 minutes or until tender. Drain in a fine-mesh sieve and then carefully submerge the sieve in a bowl of cold water. Drain again and transfer to a bowl. Cover with plastic wrap and chill.
7. Toss the chilled amaranth with the olive oil and season to taste with salt and pepper.
8. To serve, spoon some of the chilled ramp puree onto a small plate. Place a portion of the amaranth on the plate along with a small amount of pickled ramps. Repeat to make 5 more servings.
9. bunch fresh thyme, stemmed and leaves chopped
10. Cut enough of the ramp leaves into enough large squares to measure 1 cup and put them into a medium-sized glass or ceramic bowl.
11. Cut an 8-inch square of cheesecloth. Put the chopped thyme leaves and the pickling spices in the center of the cheesecloth and bring the corners together. Tie the sachet with kitchen string.
12. Put the simple syrup, vinegar, and spice sachet in a small, nonreactive saucepan. Season to taste with salt. Bring to a boil over medium-high heat. As soon as the mixture boils, reduce the heat and simmer for about 5 minutes. Remove and discard the sachet. Pour the hot liquid over the ramp leaves. Set aside to cool at room temperature for 1 hour. Cover and refrigerate until chilled.
13. Drain the ramps before serving.
