## Method

1. COntr Olling CHanges during COOKing 277
2. Pigments called anthoxanthins (an tho zan thins) and flavonoids range from pale yellow to white.
3. in the white parts of such vegetables as celery, cucumbers, and zucchini.
4. White pigments stay white in acid and turn yellow in alkaline water. to keep vegetables
5. such as cauliflower white, add a little lemon juice or cream of tartar to the cooking water.
6. (don’t add too much, though, as this may toughen the vegetable.) Covering the pot also helps
7. Cooking for a short time, especially in a steamer, helps maintain color (and flavor and nutri-
8. ents as well). Overcooking or holding too long in a steam table turns white vegetables dull yellow
9. and beets. blueberries also are colored by these red pigments. ( the red color of tomatoes and red
10. peppers is due to the same pigments that color carrots yellow or orange.)
11. Acids turn them a brighter red.
12. Alkalis turn them blue or blue-green (not a very appetizing color for red cabbage).
13. red beets and red cabbage, therefore, have their best color when cooked with a small amount
14. of acid. r ed cabbage is often cooked with tart apples for this reason.
15. When a strongly acid vegetable is desired, as for Harvard beets or braised red cabbage, add just
16. a small amount of acid at first. a cids toughen vegetables and prolong cooking time. a dd the rest
17. when the vegetables are tender.
18. 1. use a short cooking time. Overcooked red vegetables lose a lot of color.
19. 2. use only as much water as is necessary.
20. 3. Cook beets whole and unpeeled, with root and an inch of stem attached, to protect color. skins
21. easily slip off cooked beets.
22. 4. When steaming, use solid pans instead of perforated pans to retain the red juices.
23. 5. Whenever possible, serve the cooking liquid as a sauce with the vegetable.
24. green coloring, or chlorophyll, is present in all green plants. green vegetables are common in the
25. kitchen, so it is important to understand the special handling required by this pigment.
26. Acids are enemies of green vegetables. b oth acid and long cooking turn green vegetables a
27. 1. Cook uncovered to allow plant acids to escape.
28. 2. Cook for the shortest possible time. Properly cooked green vegetables are tender-crisp, not mushy.
29. 3. Cook in small batches rather than holding for long periods in a steam table.
30. Steaming is a good method for cooking many green vegetables. s team cooks food rapidly,
31. lessens the dissolving out of nutrients and flavor, and does not break up delicate vegetables. Over -
32. cooking, however, can occur rapidly in steamers.
33. Do not use baking soda to maintain green color. s oda destroys vitamins and makes texture
34. unpleasantly mushy and slippery.
35. How much water should be used when boiling? a large quantity of water helps dissolve plant
36. acids, helps preserve colors, and speeds cooking. but some cooks feel an excessive amount of nutri-
37. ents are lost. s ee the next section for further discussion.
