## Method

1. from hot air rising from the burner or charcoal, and by radiation from the glowing burner or coals.
2. 1. When heat moves directly from one item to something touching it-for example, from the top
3. 2. When heat moves from one part of something to an adjacent part of the same item-for example, from the exterior of a roast to the interior, or from a sauté pan to its handle.
4. different materials conduct heat at different speeds. Heat moves rapidly through copper and
5. aluminum, more slowly in stainless steel, more slowly yet in glass and porcelain. a ir is a poor con-
6. ductor of heat.
7. Convection occurs when heat is spread by the movement of air, steam, or liquid (including hot fat).
8. 1. Natural.
9. Hot liquids and gases rise, while cooler ones sink. Thus, in any oven, kettle of liquid, or deep-fat
10. fryer a constant, natural circulation distributes heat.
11. 2. Mechanical. in convection ovens and convection steamers, fans speed the circulation of heat. Thus, heat is
12. transferred more quickly to the food, and the food cooks faster.
13. stirring is a form of mechanical convection. Thick liquids cannot circulate as quickly as thin
14. ones, so the rate of natural convection is slower. This explains, in part, why it is so easy to scorch thick
15. soups and sauces. The heat is not carried away from the bottom of the pan quickly enough, so it stays concentrated on the bottom and scorches the food. s tirring redistributes the heat and helps pre -
16. vent this. (Using heavy pots made of a material that conducts heat well also helps prevent scorching because the pot conducts the heat more quickly and evenly across the bottom and up the sides.)
