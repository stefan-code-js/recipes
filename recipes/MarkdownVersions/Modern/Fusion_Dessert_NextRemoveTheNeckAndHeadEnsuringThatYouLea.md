## Method

1. COOKED WILD DUCK BREAST
2. To cook the ducks, the barbecue needs to be set up with a spot of very hot, white, glowing coals
3. and a cooler area, no hotter than 50°C, for resting. Place the breasts onto the hot grill on one
4. side of the crown. Rock the crown back and fo rth, alternating the cooking of each breast about
5. every 4 or 5 seconds, to cook the breasts and build up caramelization, without letting the flesh
6. seize up by resting over the high heat for too long. You should always be handling the duck,
7. turning it, and watching for hot spots and flare -ups. It will not be a quick process to caramelize
8. and brown the skin. Have a fresh towel on hand to wipe clean any fat that begins to render out,
9. to not risk flare -ups. The duck should taste beautifully caramelized, not of burnt fat. After about
10. a minute, turn it over onto its back and allow it to cook from underneath. If the charcoal flares
11. up, transfer the duck to the resting spot to rest and carry through.
12. skin over the hot charcoal. This will allow the bird to continue to caramelize, but also to crisp up
13. the skin. Continue this process of brushing oil and cooking over the entire bird -not just the
14. breasts. Monitor the in ternal temperature of the bird as you go through this process. As the bird
15. cooks, we want to reach an internal temperature of 47° to 48°C while on the grill. Once this
16. temperature is achieved, move the bird to a hanging rack above the heat to rest with ple nty of
17. radiant heat from the grill to keep the bird warm -be careful of potential drafts while on the
18. surrounding undercooked flesh.
19. The birds should rest up to an intern al temperature of 56º to 58ºC. When called out, roll the
20. bird a few more times over the heat to warm it before sending it inside. Before it goes inside,
