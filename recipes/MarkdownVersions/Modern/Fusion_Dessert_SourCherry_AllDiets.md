15. choppedRed food coloring as needed Serves 6-8
16. Cooking time
17. Electric hand beater6-in. ( 16-cm) silicone cake pan
18. butter, diced
19. Work the butter, light brown sugar, flour, ground hazelnuts and almonds, and salt together to make a fairly smooth dough. Chill for 20 minutes.
20. Preheat the oven to 350° F (180°C /Gas mark 4). Break up the dough into
21. small chunks, spread them out in the cake ring, and grate over about a tenth of the tonka bean. Bake for about 20 minutes.
22. Soak the gelatin in a bowl of cold water. Heat the milk, sugar, cream, and vanilla seeds in a saucepan and grate in another tenth of the tonka bean. Whisk the egg yolks with the glucose syrup, drizzle over a little of the hot milk, whisking constantly. Return the mixture to the pan and continue as for making a custard (see technique ) . Remove from the heat, squeeze
23. excess water from the gelatin and stir in until dissolved. Strain the custard through a fine-mesh sieve into a bowl set over a larger bowl containing ice cubes. When the custard has cooled to 68°F (20°C ), gradually stir it
24. into the mascarpone. Chill for 1 hour and then, using the electric beater,
25. Soak the gelatin in cold water. Heat the sour cherry purée and cream in a saucepan to 104° F (
26. 40°C ). Stir in the sugar and cornstarch and bring to a
27. boil, stirring constantly. Remove from the heat, squeeze excess water from the gelatin and stir in. Pour into the silicone baking pan and freeze for 1 hour.
28. Preheat the oven to 400° F (200°C /Gas mark 6). Place the silicone mat on
29. a baking sheet. In a mixing bowl, combine the invert sugar, confectioners’ sugar, flour, and almond flour. Whisk together the egg yolk and egg and gradually add to the sugar and almond mixture, whisking constantly. Mix the lemon zest with the melted butter and stir in. Whisk the egg whites with the sugar to soft peak stage and fold in carefully until combined. Spoon into the pastry bag and pipe a 6-in. ( 16-cm) disk onto the baking
30. sheet. Bake for 15-20 minutes.
31. Bring ⅓ cup ( 75 ml) of the water, the sugar and glucose to a boil in a pan.
32. Soak the gelatin in the rest of the water. Stir the condensed milk into the pan, remove from the heat, and stir in the dissolved gelatin. Pour over the chocolate, add the food coloring and process with the stick blender until smooth. When used, the glaze should be at 86° F (30°C ).
33. Line the cake ring with a strip of acetate. Place it on a sheet of acetate and pour half the mascarpone mousse into the center, spreading it to the sides of the ring with the spatula. Spoon a layer of sour cherry crémeux on top and spread more mousse over it. Top with the sponge, spread with more mousse and then scatter over the streusel crumbs. Put in the freezer until frozen (about 2 hours) and then immediately remove the acetate base and
34. strip and pour over the glaze. Add decorations as you wish, surrounding the cake with a chocolate strip tinted red .SPRING
