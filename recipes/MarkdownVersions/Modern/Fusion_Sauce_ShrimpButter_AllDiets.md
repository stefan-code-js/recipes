5. away. This butter should be made every day.
6. Place the whole chickens in a stockpot with the chicken wings, add cold water to cover, and bring to a boil. Do not skim the stock. Once the stock is up to temperature, let it boil vigorouslyfor 1 hour. Reduce the heat and allow it to simmer gently overnight (12 hours). In the morning,
7. strain the stock through a fine conical strainer and discard the chickens and wings. Once the
8. stock has settled, skim off the fat collected on the top and reserve for later use. Transfer the skimmed stock to a medium stockpot and return to the heat. At a simmer, reduce the stock to a

10. In a saucepot on the stove, add 800 mL of the finished chicken glaze with 1 heaping spoo nful o

15. multiple times, repeating the process to produce more skins (after the initial use, you want to avoid stirring the mixture together and emulsifying the fat as you reheat it. It is also importantto note that the stock can explode if air pockets on the bottom of the pot aren’t released, whichcan be achieved by tapping the bottom of the pot with a spoon as it reheats). Adjust each pot ofstock with water, new chicken glaze, or more duck fat as necessary, depending on the consistency of duck skin that you would like to yield.
16. With the skins on parchment paper, transfer them to a nonstick pan over the lowest possible heat. They will bubble gently and being to fry crisp. Before they are crispy, however, carefully remove the skin from the pan and transfer it to a clean parchment square on a cutting board.
