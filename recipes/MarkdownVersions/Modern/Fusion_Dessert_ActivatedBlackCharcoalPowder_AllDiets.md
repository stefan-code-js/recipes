## Method

1. Blend all the ingredients together in the Thermomix on high speed until well puréed. Afterward,
2. pass the mixture through a conical strainer, pressing against the solids with a ladle. Transfer the
3. mixture to 1 L containers and place in a dehydrator set to 60°C until the purée reduces in weight by 50% (be sure to occasionally stir the mixture to ensure it doesn’t cake on the surface). Onc
4. educed, re -blend the mixture with an immersion blender to smooth the texture. Add a small
5. teaspoon of the black charcoal powder to the mixture to ensure that the purée is very dark in color and blend once more with the immersion blender to ensure that the color is homogeneous.
6. beetle cut out of it. Lay a whole, uncut silpat on a flat metal tray, and place the cut silpat stenc
7. n top of it. Using an offset spatula, spread the leather mixture through the silpat stencil, onto
8. the other silpat . Carefully remove the top silpat stencil and leave the bottom silpat with the wet
9. leather mixture to dry.
10. On a separate flat metal tray, lay down another silpat . On either long edge of this silpat , lay one
11. cut silpat strip on either side. These cut strips will act as a guide to ensure a consistent depth of
12. the leather. Spread the leather mixture in between these guides and use a large offset spatu la
13. o that the leather is even and level. Remove the silpat strip guides and allow both trays of
14. leather mixture to dry on a speed rack in a well- ventilated area overnight.
15. Take the large sheet of dried leather off the silpat and transfer it to a cutting board. Cut the
16. sheet into 4 cm squares. Remove all the pieces of leather from the silpat used to form the
17. beetle’s body parts. In the middle of a 4 cm square of leather, apply 1 small semi- dried mulberry
18. (or a large one cut in half) 1 black currant bud, the coriander seed, and the angelica seed. Fold it
19. over to form an envelope -like package that will hold the contents. Trim down the rectangle on
20. corners a bit to round the edges. This should be done just before service.
21. affix the left and right wings onto the lower body, gluing them at the top of the lower body, while angling them outward. From there, affix the middle body, and finally the head above that.
