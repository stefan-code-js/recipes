## Method

1. In service, pipe on another 4 or 5 g of the rose hip paste on top of the sealed package of herbs and berries, season it with a bit of salt, and arrange the beetle segments overtop. Use 2 dots more of the paste to glue on the wing coverings. Brush the beetle with spruce wood oil, place it into a glass display box, with pins, and serve.
