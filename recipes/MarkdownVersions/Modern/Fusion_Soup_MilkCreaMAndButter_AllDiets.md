24. Curdling is a process by which milk proteins solidify and separate from the whey. Curdling is usually
25. caused by acids, tannins, salt, and heat. The mild acids in many vegetables and the tannins in pota-
26. toes are often enough to curdle milk.
27. starches partially stabilize milk and cream. This is why it is possible to make soups and sauces
28. with both milk or cream and acid ingredients. a void combining milk or cream with strong acids
29. reducing temperatures and cooking times also helps. Curdling is more likely at high heat or
30. with prolonged cooking.
31. do not add salt, or salt only lightly, unless the milk has been stabilized by starch.

33. a little of the hot liquid into it first.
