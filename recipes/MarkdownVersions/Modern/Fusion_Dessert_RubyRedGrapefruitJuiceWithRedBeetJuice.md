## Method

1. I grew up avoiding grapefruit at all costs. I could not tolerate that much sourness first thing in the morning, even when my mother sprinkled it liberally with sugar. When I worked at the Stapleford Park Hotel in Leicestershire, England, Malcolm, the gamekeeper, who knew my love of food, repeatedly urged me to try one of the grapefruit he brought to work almost daily when he brought me braces of hares and pheasant. (He also took me hunting in Scotland, where we found time to travel the “whiskey trail,” visiting the various distillers of Scotch whiskey. My education was complete!) I finally gave in to the grapefruit and wondered why I had been resistant for so many years! I joyfully ate grapefruit daily after that. When I began juicing, I juiced gorgeous Israeli Red grapefruit and Ruby Red grapefruit and sweetened the juice with a little beet juice. I don’t stir in the beet juice but instead drop little spoonfuls into the glasses so that it floats on top, kind of a lava lamp effect. It’s really pretty.
2. in a juicer. Measure the juice. There should be about 1½ cups. If you don’t have enough, peel and juice another grapefruit and add its juice to measure a total of 1½ cups of juice.
3. or fine-mesh sieve into a pitcher and stir in the lime juice. Season to taste with salt and pepper. Cover and refrigerate for 2 hours or until chilled.
4. Juice the beet in the juicer. Strain the juice through a
5. or fine-mesh sieve into a small bowl and then pour into a squeeze bottle. Cover and refrigerate for 2 hours or until chilled. Season to taste with salt and pepper.
6. Stir the grapefruit juice before pouring into small, chilled glasses for serving. Garnish with drops of beet juice.
