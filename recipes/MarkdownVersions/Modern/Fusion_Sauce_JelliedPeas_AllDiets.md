## Method

1. eed this for a paste later. The other half of the infused pea juice will be used for cooking the
2. husk juice to cover. Blanch the medium peas for approximately 45 seconds, and the small peasfor approximately 20 seconds. Feel the peas as they boil; they should easily pop out of their skin
3. when pressure is applied. Once blanched, immediately shock the peas in an ice bath.

7. Once all t he cooked peas are shelled, strain them from the clarified juice, and portion the
8. double -shelled peas into yogurt pots in 25 g portions. Keep the small peas separate and
9. together. They will be used as fillers when plating the dish. Reserve the strained clarified pea juice for plating at the end.
