4. rocess. Be sure to change the brine after a few rounds of washing the urchin.
5. Once washed, lay the urchin roe over a gastro lined with a clean, dry kitchen towel set over ice.Use another demitasse spoon or an offset spatula to separate the 5 individual tongues of u rchin
6. and transfer them to a 1 L container lined with a parchment square over ice. Ensure that each tongue has individual space in the container -i.e., don’t overcrowd the container with urchin.
