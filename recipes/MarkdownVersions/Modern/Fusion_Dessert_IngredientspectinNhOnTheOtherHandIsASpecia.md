2. or jellies) or low methoxyl (for low-sugar preparations). Yellow pectin and pectin NH can be purchased in specialty shops or online.
3. storage tips: Store tightly sealed.
4. Natural food coloring can come from animal sources (such as carmine); plant sources (including beet red and annatto); or mineral sources. Many food colorings used today are synthetically produced, and certain colors can only be made by artificial means. Use natural food dyes whenever possible, and choose between liquid, gel, or powder depending on the recipe, strength of color required, and whether or not any extra liquid can be added.
5. good to know: Always add food coloring little by little to your recipe to avoid adding too much. It is
6. always easy to add more, but impossible to take any away! Suggested quantities are provided in the recipes in this book, but keep in mind that the intensity of different brands can vary, so you may need more or less than the amount called for.
7. In addition to spices and herbs (like vanilla beans, cinnamon, saffron, and aromatic herbs), pastry chefs use a wide range of other natural flavorings to make their creations deliciously distinct. Natural flavorings include extracts (such as vanilla and coffee), flower waters (like orange blossom and rose), and natural essences sold in liquid form. Other examples include bitter almond, anise, bergamot, peppermint, coconut, and many more, all available as liquid extracts or essences. Such flavorings can be directly mixed in with the other ingredients in a given recipe. When flavorings are labeled “natural,” it means they are derived from natural sources: they may be extracted directly from animals or plants or biologically produced in a laboratory using enzymes and microbes. Spirits such as rum, kirsch, and eaux-de-vie can also be used to flavor pastries, desserts, and soaking syrups for cakes.
8. good to know: Add flavorings little by little and taste as you go until you obtain the desired strength.
9. purchasing tips: Look for pure extracts, which provide a much better flavor than essences.TYPE USES STORAGE
