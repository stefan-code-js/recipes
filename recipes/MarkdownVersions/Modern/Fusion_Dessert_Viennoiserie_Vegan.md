## Method

1. Cooking time
2. Stand mixer + paddle
3. whole wheat flour
4. and diced
5. In a saucepan, bring 31/2 tbsp (50 g/50 ml) of the soy milk to a boil. Stirring,
6. pour the soy milk over the chickpea flour in a bowl. Stir until smooth. Cover
7. night, in the refrigerator. Place the pumpkin puree and mashed banana in
8. the bowl of the stand mixer. Add the chilled chickpea flour-soy milk paste,
9. then add the all-purpose flour, remaining soy milk, and yeast. Knead on low
10. about 30 minutes). Add the salt and sugar and knead for a few minutes until
11. dissolved and well distributed. Pour in the oil in 6 equal quantities, kneading
12. after each addition until the dough has completely absorbed it. Cover the
13. bowl with plastic wrap and let ferment for 30 minutes at room temperature.
14. Gently fold the dough (see technique ), cover with plastic wrap, and chill
15. for at least l hour, or overnight.
16. Divide the dough into 30 pieces weighing 0.75 oz. (20 g) each and roll
17. them into balls. Cover with plastic wrap and let rest for 30 minutes in the
18. refrigerator. Roll into smooth balls again, then place 6 in each pan in a stag­
19. gered pattern. Let proof in a steam oven set to 77°F (25°C), or on a rack in
20. a turned-off oven above a bowl of boiling water, for l½ hours.
21. Preheat the oven to 325°F {160°C/Gas Mark3). Chill the proofed brioches in
22. the refrigerator for 5 minutes, then brush with soy milk. Combine the crumb
23. topping ingredients using your fingertips until the mixture resembles coarse
24. crumbs. Take care not to overmix, to avoid turning the crumbs into a paste.
25. stick. Bake for about 20 minutes until golden. Immediately turn the loaves
26. out of the pans and let them cool completely on a rack.
27. it gelatinizes. Using gelatinized starch in this recipe
28. locks moisture in the dough. This makes the brioche
29. for the absence of animal fats and eggs.
30. but mixing on low speed prevents it from getting too hot.
