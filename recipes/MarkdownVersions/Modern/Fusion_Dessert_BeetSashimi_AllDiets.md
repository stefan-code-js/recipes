## Method

1. Preheat the oven to 200°C (100% fan) and wash the beets well. Toss them in a bowl with the
2. kelp oil, the lemon thyme, and the salt. Wrap all the beets together in a double layer of aluminum foil, ensuring that they are tightly wrapped. Roast for 25 to 40 m inutes, depending on
3. the size of the beets. They should be fork -tender. Once properly roasted, remove the beets from
4. the oven and rest them for 40 minutes to 1 hour in the foil at room temperature. After resting,put on a pair of gloves and peel the skin f rom the beets.
5. Once peeled, transfer the beets to a vacuum bag. Each beet should have its own space in the bag so they do not lose their shape. You will need to judge how many beets can appropriately fitin each bag properly. Add enough rose oil so that the beets are coated in the oil. Seal the bag a
6. 00% vacuum and allow the beets and rose oil to rest in the fridge overnight.
7. The following day, remove the cooked beets from the vacuum bags, while reserving the rose oilleft over in the bag. Using a sharp knife, cut the cheeks of the beet off; depending on the size ofthe beets, you should be able to slice 4 or 5 cheeks per beet. Slice the cheeks north to south away from the core of the beets. Reserve the remaining cores for juice- which will be used for
8. Place one of the beet cheeks flat on a cutting board, so that the rounded side of it is facing up. With a very sharp knife, slice one edge off the beet to make a clean edge. Then, make 16 slices side by side leaving about 4 mm uncut at the top of the beet. Each slice should be as thin as possible without breaking. After 16 slices, cut all the way through the beet to separate this par
9. rom the rest of the beet cheek. The beet is cut in this way so that the 16 slices can be fanned
10. out while still being attached together. After each fan is cut from the beet cheeks, fan each piece out and transfer them to a parchment -lined 1 L container- brush a bit of rose oil onto the
11. parchment square and the beet fan. Store, covered, in the fridge until service.
12. Potassium metabisulphite bath at 0.02% concentration (1 g/5 kg water)
13. roasted beet cores
14. Wash and peel the beets. Roughly chop the raw beets and soak in metabisulphite for 10 minutes. Remove the beets from the metabisulphite solu tion and transfer to a vacuum bag. Se
15. he vacuum bag and cook at 90°C steam (100% fan) for 15 minutes. Once steamed, shock the
16. beets in an ice bath. Once cool, pass all of the contents of the vacuum bag through a juicer.
