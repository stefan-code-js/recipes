11. Prepare the macaron shells (see technique ) , adding
12. the red food coloring at step 3 .
13. Once the shells are baked and cooled, prepare the
14. spray. Place the cocoa butter and white chocolate in separate bowls over saucepans of hot water, melt both to 95°F (35°C) and then mix together. Gradually stir
15. in the red food coloring until you obtain the shade you want and then blend with the stick blender until smooth. Stand the bowl back over a pan of hot water and heat to 122° F (50°C). Strain through a fine-mesh
16. strainer and pour into the spray gun. Spray the tops of the cooled macaron shells for a velvet-like sheen.
17. Heat the raspberry and red bell pepper purées in a saucepan over low heat to 140° F (60°C). Meanwhile,
18. pan of hot water. Mix the sorbitol powder and glucose syrup together and stir into the purées. Carefully pour the purée mixture over the melted chocolate and stir with a spatula until well blended. Once the mixture cools to 95° F-104° F (35°C-40° C), add the butter and
19. blend until smooth. Cover the surface of the crémeux with plastic wrap and refrigerate for 30-40 minutes,
20. until the crémeux is cool and thick enough to be piped.
21. Spoon the filling into the pastry bag, pipe it over the flat side of half the shells, and lightly press the others on top so the filling reaches the edges. Chill for at least 2 hours before serving.CHEFS’ NOTES
