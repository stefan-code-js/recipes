## Method

1. flesh into small pieces, add the fresh verbena leaves and process
2. in a Thermomix for 10 seconds. Leave to macerate for 5 minutes,
3. then strain through a fine cloth. Weigh out 550g of the strained
4. juice (reserve the rest) and add the lemon juice, stock syrup and
5. salt. Bloom the gelatine. Warm a little of the weighed juice mixture
6. and melt the gelatine in it. Whisk in the maltodextrin and then
7. the xanthan gum. Stir into the bulk of the weighed juice mixture
8. Slice the cucumber thinly, cutting out the seedy part but keeping
9. the skin. Vacuum -pack in bags with the remaining cucumber juice
10. from the sorbet recipe for 5 minutes. Strain off the liquid and
11. reserve, and pat the slices dry with kitchen paper (paper towel).
12. Cut a sheet of acetate into pieces approximately 8 x 4cm. Lay
13. cucumber slices on each piece and roll to form a hollow cylinder.
14. Tape the acetate together to keep it tight. Keep the cylinders
15. upright to make it easier to fill them with mousse later. Whip the
16. egg whites and sugar to stiff peaks and place in the refrigerator.
17. Bloom the gelatine. Heat one-fifth of the yoghurt and add the
18. gelatine. Mix with the remaining yoghurt and stir in the lemon
19. juice. Whip the cream and fold it into the yoghurt mixture, then
20. fold the egg white mixture into the yoghurt mixture. Spoon into
21. a piping (pastry) bag and fill the cucumber cylinders. Leave to set
22. Dissolve the egg white powder in 100g of the water. Combine the
23. remaining 30g water, the vinegar, sugar and isomalt and heat in
24. a pan to 121°C (250°F). While this caramel is heating whisk the egg
25. white mixture to soft peaks. When the caramel is cooked, whisk it
26. into the egg whites. Add the verbena and keep whisking until the
27. contents of the bowl are cool. Preheat the oven to 55°C (130°F).
28. Spread the meringue on a tray and dry in the oven for 12 hours.
29. When dry, break into small, irregularly sized pieces.
30. Garnish
31. cutter, and vacuum-pack them for 4 minutes in the reserved
32. cucumber juice from the sorbet recipe. Pick out 4-5 shoots
33. of fresh verbena per person and rinse in ice water. Strain the
34. cucumber balls and keep on kitchen paper in the refrigerator.
35. and place one on each plate. Process the sorbet in a Pacojet,
36. 2S0 shape into a quenelle with a spoon and position one on each plate.
37. Add a few cucumber balls and the verbena shoots, and cover
