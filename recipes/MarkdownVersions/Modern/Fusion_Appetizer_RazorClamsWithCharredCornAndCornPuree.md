## Method

1. I particularly like the long, beautiful, brown-and-yellow shells for presentation, which means this is a dish that easily impresses. Take care when handling the shells; they’re sharp and delicate, and can easily crack. The charred corn marries happily with the clams and you will note that the cup of white wine needed for cooking the clams provides a fair amount of acid, which makes the flavor of the clams pop.
2. shallot, finely chopped
3. After rinsing and scrubbing the clams, lay them in a single layer on a tray or in a shallow dish. Handle the clams carefully; the shells are fragile and can easily crack. Sprinkle liberally with kosher or coarse salt and let them sit for about 15 minutes. Rinse and repeat. Rinse the clams very well before proceeding with the recipe. The salt draws the clams from their shells and in the process cleans them of sand and grit.
4. Put the clams in a medium-sized saucepan with the white wine, chopped shallot, and sprigs of thyme. Cover the pan and steam over high heat, shaking the pan occasionally, for about 5 minutes or until the clams become firm. These clams won’t open like a normal clam, but the protruding meat will become firm and opaque. Remove from the heat. Remove the clams from the liquid (discard any that have not opened) and chill thoroughly. Discard the liquid.
5. To char the corn, heat a small heavy-bottomed sauté pan or cast-iron skillet over medium-high heat. When the pan is hot, add 1 cup of the corn kernels to the pan and cook, turning, until all the kernels are charred and cooked through. Remove the pan from the heat and spread the corn on a flat plate to cool.
6. In a medium-sized saucepan filled with boiling water, blanch the remaining ½ cup of corn kernels for 1 to 2 minutes or until tender. Drain the corn.
7. Combine the ½ cup blanched corn kernels with a small amount of water in a blender and puree. With the motor running, add as much additional water as necessary to form a saucelike consistency. Season to taste with salt and pepper. Strain through a
8. or fine-mesh sieve into a small bowl.
9. Remove the clams from their shells, keeping the bottom shells and discarding the top shells. Using only the meat that protruded from the shells (the sand sacks in the shells can very easily get mixed up with the meat inside the shell, so be very careful), thinly slice the clams and toss with the olive oil to separate the slices. Season lightly with salt and pepper.
10. To serve, sprinkle some charred corn on a reserved shell. Arrange some of the sliced clams over the corn. Spoon a small amount of corn sauce over the slices and sprinkle with a few more kernels of charred corn. Repeat to make 5 to 9 more servings.
