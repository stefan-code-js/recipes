## Method

1. Combi ne the tamari and vinegar in a small pot. Add the roasted kelp salt and warm over low
2. heat to dissolve. Once dissolved, slowly whisk in the butter to emulsify. Once emulsified, keep
3. g Lacto Koji Water* (made with Øland Wheat Koji*)

5. immersion blender. Season with salt to taste and reserve in the pot until service.
6. Hokkaido pumpkin (1.5 to 1.8 kg)
7. Using a sharp knife, remove the top and bottom from the pumpkin. Cut the pumpkin in half
8. longitudinally. Remove the seeds from the pumpkin using a spoon and cut the skin off each half
9. of the pumpkin. After removing the skin, cut the pumpkin halves in half again, but this time
10. latitudinally. Line up your 4 quarters of pumpkin o n your cutting board and use a sharp knife to
11. cut portions that are 2 cm thick and (at least) 10 cm long. You should be cutting with the grain ofthe pumpkin to achieve these portions (cutting in the same longitudinal direction). Line up eachcut piece of pumpkin in a vacuum bag so that they are lying on their side and stacked up, as if each piece is spooning another piece. Add enough pumpkin seed oil to the bag to coat each portion of pumpkin and season each piece with a bit of salt. Seal each bag in the v acuum
12. machine on full and cook in a steam oven set to 90°C (100% fan) for 28 minutes. After 28 minutes of steaming, immediately shock the pumpkin in an ice bath. Once fully cool, transfer thepumpkin to the fridge to rest for a minimum of 12 hours (or overnight).
13. The following day, remove the pumpkin from the vacuum bag. Using a sharp knife, trim down each portion of pumpkin to a weight of 28 to 30 g. You may need to scrape out some of the inside part of the pumpkin (where the seeds were), as it can get qu ite mushy after cooking.
