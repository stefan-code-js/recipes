## Method

1. Dungeness crab is the quintessential California seafood, although the crabs are harvested from Mexico to Alaska. I first tasted it about ten years ago, when chef-owner Michael Chiarello from Tra Vigne restaurant in St. Helena, California (one of my favorite restaurants in the world), cooked a whole crab in a wood-burning oven. It was so smoky, juicy, and just plain delicious, I decided to create an amuse that mimicked the smokiness of that dish with charred peppers. Dungeness crab is nearly always sold already cooked-unless you’re lucky enough to buy it fresh off a boat on the West Coast. Then you’ll have to cook it yourself.
2. ½ pound cooked Dungeness crab meat
3. ½ cup pitted and chopped Picholine olives, plus 1 to 2 tablespoons for garnishing
4. Celery leaves, for garnishing
5. Pick through the crabmeat to remove any bits of shell. Put the meat in a medium-sized bowl.
6. Gently stir the celery and mayonnaise into the crabmeat and season to taste with salt and pepper. Cover and chill until ready to use.
7. Lightly char the peppers over a grill or gas flame, or under a broiler, until blackened on all sides and soft. When cool enough to handle, remove and discard the skins, ribs, and seeds. Coarsely chop the peppers. Reserve a small amount of diced peppers for garnishing.
8. Transfer the yellow peppers to a blender. Add a little water if necessary, and puree until smooth. Scrape the puree from the blender into a small bowl.
9. Transfer the red peppers to the blender. Add a little water if necessary, and puree until smooth. Scrape the puree from the blender into a small bowl.
10. Combine the olives and the ½ cup water in the blender and puree until the mixture is fluid. Slowly pour in the oil and puree until emulsified. Transfer the olive puree to a small bowl.
11. To serve, use 2 small spoons to form the crabmeat into oval-shaped quenelles. Put a quenelle on a small plate, then spoon some of the pepper and olive purees around the plate. Garnish with the reserved diced peppers, a celery leaf, and some chopped olives. Repeat to make 5 more servings.
