## Method

1. Use twice the quantity of beef in basic recipe. Add 8 oz (250 g) leeks to
2. Use chicken stock instead of beef or veal stock. Add to the clearmeat 8 oz (250 g) chicken trimmings (such as wing tips and necks) that have been chopped and browned in a hot oven. Omit tomato and add 1 fl oz (30 mL)
3. Unflavored gelatin must often be added to consommé to make jellied
4. consommé. Amount needed depends on the strength of the stock and amount of jelling desired. Classically, a chilled consommé is only half jelled,
5. more like a thick syrup. Some people, however, prefer a gelatin content
6. high enough to solidify the consommé. In the following guidelines, use the lower quantity of gelatin for a partially jelled soup, the higher quantity for a fully jelled soup. Also, for tomatoed consommé (madrilène), increase the
7. gelatin slightly because the acidity of the tomatoes weakens the gelatin.
8. 1. If stock is thin when cold, add 1-2 oz (30-60 g) gelatin per gallon (4 L).
9. 2. If stock is slightly jelled and syrupy when cold, add ½-1 oz
10. (15-30 g) gelatin per gallon (4 L).
11. 3. If stock is jelled when cold, no gelatin is needed. Add up to ½ oz
12. (15 g) per gallon (4 L) if firmer texture is desired.
13. Gelatin may be added to clearmeat (in step 2 of recipe). This is the best method because there is no danger of clouding the consommé. It may
14. also be added to finished consommé after softening it in cold water. See
15. page 720 for instructions on use of gelatin.
16. Increase the tomatoes in the basic recipe to 24 oz (750 g). Use beef, veal, or chicken stock. Serve hot or jellied.
17. Increase the celery in the basic recipe to 1 lb (500 g).Consommé au p orto
18. Flavor finished consommé with 6-8 fl oz (200-250 mL) port wine per gallon (4 L).
19. Flavor finished consommé with 6-8 fl oz (200-250 mL) sherry wine per gallon (4 L).

23. be cut shorter than for other applications.
