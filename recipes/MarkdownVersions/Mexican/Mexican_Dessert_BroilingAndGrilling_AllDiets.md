2. salt, pepper, ground cumin, and ground allspice.
3. 2. place the salmon steaks in the mixture, turning them to coat both sides.
4. 3. refrigerate 30-60 minutes.
5. 4. heat the oil in a sauté pan over moderate heat.
6. 5. add the onion. Sauté until lightly browned.
7. 6. add the garlic and jalapeños. Sauté 2-3 minutes.
8. 7. add the sachet, vinegar, and water. Simmer over low heat until reduced by half.

13. beche means “pickled.” Many foods en escabeche are popular in the cui-sines of Mexico, especially seafood and vegetables. The method originated
14. as a way to preserve foods by pickling them in vinegar and spices. Today,
15. with refrigeration available, they are enjoyed for their flavors more than their keeping qualities.
16. In a true escabeche, the food is left in the vinegar mixture for a time at
17. room temperature or refrigerated long enough for it to develop a pickled taste. It is later served at room temperature or rewarmed. In addition, fish prepared this way is often pan-fried in oil before being pickled. The accom-panying recipe is modified from the traditional methods for a lighter flavor. The fish is grilled rather than pan-fried, and the spice and vinegar mixture
18. is served with it as a sauce rather than being used to pickle it.
