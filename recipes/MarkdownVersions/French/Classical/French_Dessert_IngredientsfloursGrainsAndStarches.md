## Method

1. WHEAT FLOUR
2. Along with butter, sugar, and eggs, flour is one of the most important ingredients in pastry making. For
3. successful results, be sure to use the type of flour indicated. Unless stated otherwise, “flour” means all-purpose flour.
4. Gluten is formed by two proteins, glutenin and gliadin, which occur naturally in certain grains, including wheat, rye, barley, spelt, and oats. When liquid is added to flour, these two proteins bind together to make gluten, which plays a crucial role in the leavening and texture of baked goods. Kneading or mixing develops the web-like gluten network, which is particularly important for yeasted bread and brioche-type doughs. Gluten gives such doughs elasticity and traps gas as the dough bakes, helping it rise. In the case of delicate cakes, pastries, and tart crusts, you need to avoid overmixing, because if too much gluten develops, it can make the texture dense and tough. The type of flour used in a given recipe, particularly the protein con -
5. tent (a good indicator of the gluten content), is also critical to successful results. Flours with more gluten, sometimes referred to as “strong” or “hard,” produce lighter, airier breads with a pleasant chewy texture. Lower-protein flours, on the other hand, are better for more delicate pastries and cakes.
6. - In a cool, dry, and well-ventilated place, to prevent it from turning rancid- In an airtight container, to protect it from humidity
7. There are many flavorful alternative flours made from grains or nuts, like buckwheat, rye, spelt, or chest -
8. nuts, which are sometimes used in breads or regional specialties. Such flours should be stored in the same conditions as wheat flour.TYPE APPROXIMATE
