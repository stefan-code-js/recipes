## Method

1. THE BREAD AT SAN FRANCISCO’S LEGENDARY TARTINE BAKERY sells out within
2. an hour almost every day. At 5 P.M., these rugged, magnificent loaves are drawn from
3. the oven. The first cut yields steam and room-filling aroma, exposing an open and tender
4. interior underneath the burnished, substantial crust. This distinctive bread was developed
5. by renowned baker Chad Robertson over a decade of working with the finest artisan
6. bakers in the United States and France, followed by another decade baking solo in a small
7. wood-fired oven on the coast of Northern California. The following for this singular
8. bread far exceeds the bakery’s limited daily production.
9. Only a handful of bakers have apprenticed to learn the techniques Chad has developed.
10. Now it’s your turn to make this bread with your own hands. Clear instructions and
11. exceptional and elemental bread using just flour, water, and salt.
12. lead to wonderfully diverse breads. Soon you will be able to create your own unique and
13. personal loaf. Also included are more than 30 sweet and savory recipes using the day-old
14. bread to make sandwiches, classic soups, puddings, delicious baked French toast, and an
15. addictive Kale Caesar.
