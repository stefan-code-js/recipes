## Method

1. To mix the baguette dough, measure the 400 grams of leaven and set
2. aside the remainder to refresh and maintain as your starter. Pour the warm water
3. into a large mixing bowl. Add the poolish and the leaven and stir to disperse. Add
4. the all-purpose flour and the bread flour. Using your hands, mix thoroughly until
5. no bits of dry flour remain. The baguette dough initially will feel a little stiffer
6. than the basic country dough, but it will soften during bulk fermentation. Let the
7. dough rest for 25 to 40 minutes.
8. begin the bulk fermentation at a temperature of about 75°F. Turn the dough about
9. every 40 minutes as instructed in step 5 on page 54; add the salt with the first turn.
10. the dough into two or three pieces, depending on the size of your baking stone.
11. Shape each piece into a rectangle with rounded corners. Let rest on the work sur -
12. closest to you up and over the middle third. Holding the ends of the dough, stretch
13. it horizontally so that it doubles in width. Fold the third of the dough farthest
14. envelope. Press on this flap to develop tension in the dough. Using your palms and
15. the outer edge of your palms and fingers to further develop tension in the dough.
16. You should end up with a cylinder of dough shaped like a French rolling pin.
17. Place both palms on the dough cylinder and roll it back and forth, stretching the
18. required than for other shapes. With practice and persistence, this part of the
19. process will become second nature.
20. Place the loaves on the floured towel seam-side up and separate them
21. with folds in the towel. Bring the sides of the towel over the loaves to support the
22. outer edges. Let rise at warm room temperature (70° to 75°F) for 2½ to 3 hours.
23. Place the baking stone on the middle rack of the oven and preheat the oven
24. to 500°F. When using a baking stone, the trick is to saturate the oven with steam
25. when you start baking. The best way to get as much steam as possible into a home
