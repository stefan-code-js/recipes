## Method

1. While this is a tasty little amuse, another version I made at Brasserie T was also delicious. (A similar recipe for it is in my 1997 book, American Brasserie.) As much as I love the style of cooking we do at Tru, I am equally fond of a more informal style, such as that practiced at brasseries and trattorias. This makes sense, since I was trained in French country cooking and grew up in a family that was passionate about Italian country food. Someday I would love to open another casual-dining restaurant. When I worked in London, I was happily involved with the reopening of the Criterion Brasserie in Piccadilly Circus, which is housed in a landmark building and has existed on and off for generations. You may recall that it was at the very real Criterion that the fictional Sherlock Holmes met Watson to discuss his cases.
2. These little warm onion tarts are lovely amuse and get any winter meal off to a good start. Vary them with different kinds of onions. Julia Child has commented that cooking would be in a sorry state indeed if it weren’t for onions. I agree!
3. Peel and cut the onion in half through the root. Trim the ends and then julienne the onion lengthwise.
4. Melt the butter in a small sauté pan over medium heat. Add the onion and thyme and cook, stirring occasionally, for 10 to 15 minutes or until the onion is a deep golden brown. Season to taste with salt and pepper. Keep warm until ready to serve.
5. Meanwhile, preheat the oven to 400°F.
6. Unfold the puff pastry sheet on a lightly floured work surface and turn over to prevent the creases from splitting. Pat down gently to flatten the sheet.
7. Using a 1-inch round fluted cookie cutter, stamp out 6 rounds and transfer to an ungreased baking sheet. Bake for 8 to 10 minutes or until puffed and golden brown.
8. Transfer the rounds to a wire rack to cool. When cool enough to handle, use a serrated knife to split each round in half horizontally.
9. Assemble the tarts on small plates by spooning a generous amount of the warm onion mixture onto each of the bottom halves. Replace the tops and serve immediately on small plates.
