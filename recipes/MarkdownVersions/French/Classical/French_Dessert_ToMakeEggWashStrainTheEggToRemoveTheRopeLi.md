## Method

1. To make egg wash, strain the egg to remove the rope-like white strands and add a pinch of salt to make
2. the egg wash more liquid. When brushing puff pastry, don’t use too much, and avoid brushing along the pastry edges as the leaves will “glue” together and prevent the pastry rising evenly in the oven.
3. Brioches baked in molds are very moist so turn them out straight away to avoid them reabsorbing any steam, as the moisture will soften them.
4. The butter should be cut into small dice so it melts quickly while the milk and water are coming to a boil. This ensures the liquids evaporate less so the proportions of the ingredients do not change.
5. Pressing the prongs of a fork lightly on the top of choux buns and éclairs makes them rise evenly, without any unsightly bumps. Some pastry chefs use a

7. Uncooked choux pastry has to be shaped as soon as it’s made so it rises evenly. Once choux pastries are baked, transfer them to a cooling rack straight away, as they will go soggy if left to reabsorb any steam.
8. Once choux pastry has been shaped or piped onto a baking sheet, it can be frozen. Baked, unfilled choux buns, such as éclairs, can also be frozen. To defrost, spread them out on a cooling rack and let them thaw in the refrigerator. You might need to heat them briefly in a 200° F (100°C /Gas mark

The crisp craquelin contrasts with the soft choux pastry, and the brown sugar adds a
12. hint of caramel. As for fillings, vanilla, chocolate, or coffee-flavored pastry creams are traditional for iced éclairs and choux buns, but you can experiment with any flavor of your choice. Round choux puffs are versatile as you can simply fill them with Chantilly cream, and for profiteroles, sandwich small buns with vanilla ice cream, and cover in molten chocolate sauce.This pastry originated in
