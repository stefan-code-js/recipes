6. 245°C) for the first 10 minutes to develop steam. then reduce the heat to 375°-425°F (190°-215°C)
7. to finish baking and set the structure. the products must be firm and dry before being removed from
8. the oven. i f they are removed too soon or cooled too quickly, they may collapse. s ome bakers like
9. to leave them in a turned-off oven with the door ajar.
