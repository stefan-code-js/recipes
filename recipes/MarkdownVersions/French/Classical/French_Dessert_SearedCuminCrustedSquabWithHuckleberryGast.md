## Method

1. In a small saucepan, combine the lentils, onion, carrot, and celery and pour the water over them. Bring to a boil, reduce the heat, and simmer for 25 to 30 minutes or until the vegetables are tender but not soft. Drain the lentils into a colander and transfer to a small bowl. Cover and set aside to keep warm.
2. Coat the squab all over with the cumin and season to taste with salt and pepper.
3. Heat a small sauté pan over medium-high heat. When the pan is hot, sear the squab breast, skin side down, for 3 to 4 minutes or until the skin is golden brown and crisp. Turn and cook for 1 to 2 minutes longer until the meat is medium. Transfer to a plate and allow to rest for 5 minutes.
4. To serve, slice the squab into 6 equal portions. Spoon some of the lentils onto a small plate and top with a slice of squab. Surround the lentils with a drizzle of huckleberry
5. . Garnish each dish with a thyme sprig and dust the plate with a little cumin. Repeat to make 5 more servings.
6. Bring the wine to a boil in a small nonreactive saucepan over medium-high heat. Cook for about 20 minutes or until the wine is reduced to ¼ cup.
7. Combine the sugar and water in a small, heavy-bottomed saucepan. Stir until the sugar is evenly moistened. Cook over medium-low heat, without stirring, for 3 to 5 minutes or until the sugar is completely melted and caramelized. When the sugar begins to caramelize, swirl the pan to even out the color.
8. Off the heat, carefully pour the vinegar into the sugar all at once. The mixture will bubble up. Return to the heat and whisk constantly until the caramel is smooth and well blended. Add the reduced red wine and the huckleberries. Simmer over low heat for about 15 minutes or until reduced to ½ cup. Serve at once or cover and refrigerate for up to 2 days. Warm gently before using.
