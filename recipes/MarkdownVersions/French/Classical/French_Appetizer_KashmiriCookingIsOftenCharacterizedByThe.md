## Method

1. Kashmiri cooking is often characterized by the
2. contrast of warm roasted fennel seeds, astringent ginger, and sweet saffron. This trio travels well across global cooking styles, and is a great match for mushrooms and seafood - both feature in this indulgent dish of scallops in a vibrant take on French butter sauce. SPICED SCALLOPS
3. and leave to soak in 2 tablespoons of warm water for 1 hour.
4. For the spiced mushroom seasoning, heat the oven to 120°C (250°F/Gas ½). Thinly slice the mushrooms and spread out in a
5. single layer on a baking tray lined with baking parchment. Bake for
6. hours, or until the mushrooms are crisp. Remove from the oven
7. Heat a small frying pan over a medium heat and toast the
8. fennel seeds for 1 minute, until fragrant. Grind the toasted
9. Put the dried mushrooms in a small food processor and add the fennel, ginger, and salt. Process until coarsely ground, and set
10. aside. The mix will keep for 2-3 weeks in a tightly lidded jar.
11. For the beurre blanc, pour the vinegar and wine into a small pan and add the diced shallot and peppercorns. Bring to the boil, and
12. then simmer for 4-6 minutes, until it has reduced to 1-2 tablespoons and looks syrupy.
13. Strain the liquid and discard the shallots. Whisk in the saffron
14. and its soaking water. Return the liquid to the rinsed-out pan
15. and cook for about 15 minutes over a low heat, whisking in the butter gradually, one cube at a time. The sauce will emulsify and thicken so that it just coats the back of a spoon. Season and sharpen the sauce with a squeeze of lemon, and keep it warm.
16. Heat a dry frying pan over a medium heat. Brush both sides
17. mushroom mix. Cook the scallops for 1-2 minutes on each side, depending on their size. T ake care not to overcook - they are ready when they are opaque but still tender.
