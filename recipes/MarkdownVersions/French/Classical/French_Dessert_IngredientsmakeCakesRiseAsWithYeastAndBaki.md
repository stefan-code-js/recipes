## Ingredients

- CREAM OF TARTAR

## Method

1. Baking powder is a chemical leavener composed of a mild acid (such as cream of tartar or tartaric acid); a mild alkali (usually baking soda, also known as bicarbonate of soda); and a drying element (like cornstarch or potato starch). When the acid and alkali come into contact with moisture, they react to produce carbon dioxide. This gas produces bubbles in the batter, which make your baked goods rise. Double-acting baking powders in the US also react a second time when exposed to the heat of the oven.
2. storage tips: Baking powder should be kept in an airtight container in a cool, dry place. It gradually
3. loses its strength, so should be used within several months and before the use-by date.
4. ADDITIVES
5. These additives serve to improve certain characteristics of foods, such as taste or texture, or to increase the storage time. Some, like salt, have been used for millennia. Others have been more recently put to use in cooking after years of research and experimentation.
6. Salt is essential for balanced flavor. Unless otherwise specified, use fine sea salt, which easily dissolves into other ingredients. Fleur de sel is excellent for finishing and adding a pleasant crunch to French shortbread cookies ( sablés ). If you cannot find fleur de sel, use fine sea salt flakes instead.
7. Cream of tartar is tartaric acid that has been ground and partially neutralized. The resulting fine white powder is often used as the acidic component in baking powder. Alone, cream of tartar can help stabilize beaten egg whites-just add a pinch while the whites are being whipped.
8. storage tips: Store tightly sealed in a cool, dry place.BAKING POWDER TIPS
9. • Respect the quantities given in the recipes.
10. Too much baking powder can give your baked goods
11. an unpleasant taste or make them rise too much.• Baking powder begins to act as soon as
12. it is mixed into the batter, so you must get it
13. into the oven quickly, before the reaction slows.
