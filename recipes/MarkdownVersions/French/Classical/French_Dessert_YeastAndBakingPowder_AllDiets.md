## Method

1. BAKER’S YEAST
2. Baker’s yeast, a living, microscopic fungus, is a vital ingredient in leavened breads. Through the process of fermentation, yeast transforms the sugars in flour into carbon dioxide, which in turn makes dough and bread rise. Yeast also gives bread a distinctive aroma and flavor. Baker’s yeast comes in many forms: fresh (also known as cake or compressed yeast); active dry; instant; and rapid- or quick-rise. Most professional bakers and pastry chefs use fresh yeast, although active dry and instant yeasts (both dried) also produce excellent results if used properly. If a recipe calls for fresh yeast, use 50% of the weight in active dry
3. yeast or 40% of the weight in instant yeast. Fresh and instant yeasts can be directly added to doughs, but
4. active dry yeast must first be proofed in warm water to activate the dormant yeast cells. Rapid- or quick-rise yeast works faster than other yeasts, but it is not recommended for the recipes in this book because it also produces an inferior flavor.

9. Baking soda, or bicarbonate of soda, is one of the ingredients in baking powder, but it can also be used as a leavener on its own, although it is not often used in French pâtisserie. Baking soda is alkaline, so it needs to be mixed with an acidic ingredient like yogurt or milk to react and form the carbon dioxide bubbles that BAKER’S YEAST TIPS
