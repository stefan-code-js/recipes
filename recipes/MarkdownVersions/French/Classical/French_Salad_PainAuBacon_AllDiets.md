## Method

1. Earlier in the book I pointedly wrote about how the craft of an artisan baker is most
2. evident when the ingredients are just flour, water, salt, and yeast. But man, this is great
3. the other doughs, which complements the fattiness of the bacon.
4. owner of the Portland restaurant Paley’s Place, wishes I would make this bread for him
5. every day. And after he suggested it for French toast, he recanted and said, “The bread is
6. too precious to cook with. I just want to eat it!”
7. This bread is impressive eaten still warm from the oven or grilled. It soars when
8. toasted and served with eggs and chilled cider or a glass of bubbly. It shines when made
9. into warm, crisp croutons for use in a salad vinaigrette. It sings tenor high notes in a BLT
10. sandwich with lemony mayonnaise and fresh ripe tomatoes. Toasted bacon bread
11. squares with steelhead roe, anyone? Or how about served with a traditional Maryland
12. passion fruit. Here in Oregon, it goes great with roasted pears. Maybe the ultimate Elvis
13. sandwich would be this bacon bread with peanut butter and bananas. And more bacon.
14. pure levain doughs in this book. The bacon fat makes the yeast extra happy, so the dough
15. THIS RECIPE MAKES 2 LOAVES, EACH ABOUT 1½ POUNDS.
16. Feed the levain at 9 a.m., mix the final dough at 7 p.m., shape
17. into loaves between 7 a.m. and 8 a.m. the next morning, and bake at 11
18. Whole wheat flour
