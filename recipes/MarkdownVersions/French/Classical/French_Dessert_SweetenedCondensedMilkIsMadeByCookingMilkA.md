## Method

1. Sweetened condensed milk is made by cooking milk at high heat until
2. more than half of the water content evaporates. Sugar is then added, resulting in a thick, sweet syrup that works well in shiny glazes.
3. be stored in a cool, dry place. After opening, it should be kept in the refrigerator at a maximum temperature of 43°F (6°C) and consumed
4. within about 3 days. Check the label for the manufacturers’ storage recommendations.
5. Evaporated milk is made in the same way as sweetened condensed milk, but no sugar is added. It is called unsweetened condensed milk in many countries. Evaporated milk contributes creaminess to prepa -
6. rations like caramels and glazes.
7. ditions as sweetened condensed milk.
8. portant, for the texture and flavor it imparts. In pâtisserie, both pas -
9. teurized unsalted and salted butters are used. Try to get butter with as high a butterfat content as you can (preferably a minimum of 82% ):
10. the higher the fat content, the less water the butter contains, which equates to creamier, more flavorful butter and flakier crusts. Successful pastries also depend on the temperature and texture of the butter used, so always take care to prepare the butter as indicated in a given recipe before mixing it together with the other ingredients (see the
11. Butter Techniques table on ) .
12. available from small creameries and major brands alike. Both can be found in most well-stocked supermarkets and online. Although most regular butter in the US has a butterfat content of around 80% , this
13. will still produce good results.
14. perature of between 32°F and 40° F (0°C and 4°C). Be sure to wrap
15. your butter well, because it easily absorbs odors.
16. inated doughs like those for croissants and puff pastries. For such
17. of 84% . This high-fat butter is also sometimes called dry butter ( beurre
18. sec), because it contains less water than lower-fat butters. One of
19. the advantages of “dry” butter is that it melts more slowly than other butters and is thus easier to work with when making doughs requiring lots of folds and turns. It also results in flakier pastries and superior flavor. If you cannot find beurre de tourage , cultured European-style
20. butters with at least 84% butterfat are the best substitute.
21. Browned butter is made by heating butter beyond the melting point until the milk proteins begin to caramelize, resulting in a golden brown color and a slightly nutty aroma. To make browned butter, gently heat your butter, stirring frequently, until it is light brown, then carefully submerge the bottom of the saucepan in cold water to quickly stop the cooking process and prevent burning. Strain the melted butter through cheesecloth or a fine-mesh strainer and use it to give an irresistible nutty flavor to cookies and cakes like financiers or madeleines.
22. Clarified butter is pure butterfat obtained by melting regular butter and removing the milk solids, water, and other impurities. Because clarified butter is 100% fat, it has a higher smoke point than regular
23. butter and does not burn as easily. Clarified butter can be purchased, but you can also make it at home. To make your own, melt unsalted butter in a saucepan over very low heat and let it simmer gently, with -
24. out stirring, until a foamy white layer forms on top. Skim as much of the foam off the surface as you can. Once the butter stops foaming, remove the pan from the heat. Carefully pour the top layer of clear golden butterfat through a strainer into a separate container, leaving the milk solids at the bottom of the pan.
25. remember to remove the butter from the refrigerator
26. at least 30 minutes before starting.
27. • Dice butter into small ¼-in. ( 6-mm) pieces
28. to make it easier to mix into doughs and batters.
29. • Cut butter into pieces for melting.
30. once the temperature reaches 248° F (120° C).
31. • In pastry making, there is no substitute for butter.
