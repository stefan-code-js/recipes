## Method

1. the skin into the cooking liquid and simmer for 1 hour. Once cooked, remov e the skins, and dry
2. them on a parchment -lined gastro tray in an oven at 80°C (50%) for 2 hours. Once dried, remove
3. them from the oven and hold them in a covered container until needed. When portioning, cutthe sheets of skin into 1.5 cm squares, and make a small cut from the center of the square to one of the edges so that the skin can fit on the duck leg bone. Using 2 pieces of skin per portion,fry the amount of duck skin needed for the day in a pot of grapeseed oil heated to 170°C. Fry
4. until the pieces of skin are crisp and the bubbling subsides. Once crisp, dry them on a paper
5. towel -and hold them in a dehydrator set to 60°C to keep them crisp until needed.
6. those pieces as large as possible -bite size. Starting with pieces of leg flesh, make incisions with
7. a sharp knife and thread the meat onto the duck bone skewer. Use as many pieces from the h
8. eg as is required -it should be approximately 20 g of meat. Once the skewer is filled, reserve it
9. in a covered container in the fridge.
