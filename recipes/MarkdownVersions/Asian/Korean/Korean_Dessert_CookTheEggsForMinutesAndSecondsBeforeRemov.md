## Method

1. Cook the eggs for 3 minutes and 40 seconds, before removing them immediately from the bath
2. and shocking them in the ice water. Allow the eggs to sit in the ice water for at least 5 minutes, but as they are sitting, use the back of a small spoon to carefully fracture their shells all over, giving them the appearance of marble. Once the eggs are sufficiently cooled, return them to the
3. boiling water for 5 seconds, to shock and release the shell from the flesh. Transfer them to a
4. container and peel them very carefully of all their shell. Once peeled, set them aside.
5. Take a 3 L canning jar and run it through a dishwasher cycle. After the cycle, while the jar is still
6. steaming, spray it with an ethanol mixture, and leave it to air- dry completely. Once dry, carefully
7. place all the peeled eggs into the jar. Bring the elderberry vinegar, spices, and salt to a boil in
8. resh pot on the stove. As it comes to temperature, cut out a parchment cartouche the size of
9. the jar’s m outh. Once the vinegar is at a healthy boil, pour the contents of the pot over the eggs.
10. Place the cartouche over the top, making sure it sits flat over the surface of the liquid, and se al
11. he jar. Allow the jar to sit at room temperature for 20 minutes, t hen proceed to transfer it to
12. the fridge for storage until needed.
13. When needed, remove the eggs from the pickling liquid, taking the oldest eggs first, and store them in a sealed container. Remove some of the pickling liquid from the jars and dilute it withan equal amount of water -keep it on hand. Shortly before service, vacuum seal the eggs,
14. Set up a water bath with an immersion circulator set to 68 °C. Place the eggs in the water bath
15. and cook them for 30 minutes. Afterward, remove the eggs from the water bath and shock themin ice water. Once cooled, crack them and separate the yolks from the whites (you may need torinse them gently under cold water to wash off any egg white still adhering to the yolk), then cure the yolks in beef garum for 1 hour. Once cured, remove the eggs from the cure and reserve.
16. Place the cured egg yolks into a mixing bowl and begin to gently whip them smooth before adding the whey and tamari. Keep mixing until the sauce becomes homogeneous. Season with
17. salt if necessary. Transfer the sauce to the vacuum machine and compress it 2 or 3 times to de-
18. air it. The texture of the sauce should be like a cake batter. The thickness of this sauce is very
19. important to the dish. Reserve the sauce in a piping bag for service.
