## Method

1. Always buy clams from a reputable merchant. If you buy them from a roadside truck or stand, you can’t be sure they were harvested in clean waters. Make sure hard-shell clams, such as littleneck, cherrystone, and Manila, are tightly closed; if one is gaping open, poke it. If it doesn’t snap closed, don’t cook it. Cherrystones are a little larger than littlenecks. For this recipe, be sure you are buying Atlantic littlenecks; Pacific littlenecks are a bit tougher. Manila clams, also called Japanese clams, tiny and sweet, taste great here.
2. shallot, finely chopped
3. cup diced
4. Put the clams in a medium-sized saucepan with the white wine, chopped shallot, and sprigs of thyme. Cover the pan and steam over high heat, shaking the pan occasionally, for about 5 minutes or until all the clams have opened. Using a slotted spoon, lift the clams from the cooking broth and discard any that have not opened. Refrigerate until thoroughly chilled.
5. Using a Japanese mandolin fitted with the fine-shredding blade, julienne the cucumber lengthwise, avoiding the seedy center part. If you don’t have a mandolin, slice the cucumber lengthwise into very thin slices using a sharp knife.
6. In a saucepan filled with lightly salted simmering water, blanch the cucumber for 30 seconds. Drain and immediately submerge in cold water. Drain again and transfer to a small bowl to cool.
7. To serve, leave the clams in their bottom shells. Twirl a small, pretty seafood fork in the cucumber, securing enough for 1 portion. Lay the fork on top of a clam on a small plate. Garnish with diced cucumber aspic. Repeat to make 5 to 9 more servings.
