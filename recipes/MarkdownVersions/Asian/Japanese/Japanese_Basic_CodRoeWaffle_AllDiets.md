## Method

2. g buckwheat flour
3. g Roasted Kelp Powder*
4. Brown Butter,* in a squeeze bottle, for cooking
5. In a mixing bowl, sift and mix all the dry ingredients. In a separate mixing bowl, combine all the
6. wet ingredients except the brown butter and whisk until mixed. Whisk the dry ingredients intothe wet ingredients and mix well. When fully incorporated, transfer this finished batter to piping
7. bags and refrigerate to rest for 1 hour.
8. Once the batter has rested, set up an electric waffle iron, and heat it to setting 6. Across the center of the hot iron, add a bit of brown butter an d pipe 2 small circles of batter side by side,
9. each about the size of a bottle cap. Close the iron and apply pressure for 5 seconds. Open the
10. iron, pipe 2 circles again, and close the iron for another 2 minutes. Once cooked, remove the
11. waffle from the iron and punch out 2 portions using a 7.5 cm ring mold. If the waffles are not
