## Method

1. Warm the koji oil in a frying pan on the stove. Add t he ginger, pasilla, coriander, and cardamom
2. and cook until the oil heats and aromatizes. From there, add the remaining 50 g dried
3. strawberries and the rose hips. Sauté them until they heat up slightly and begin to sweat slightly. Add the cold -infused dashi and the garum and cook the mixture until much of the liquid
4. has evaporated and the whole mixture attains the texture of a compote. Pass the contents of the pan through a tamis lined with a fine -mesh nylon sieve and fold the brunoised strawberries
5. through the mixture, seasoning with salt to taste if needed. Reserve in piping bags in the fridge.
6. Cut the rose hip in half from top to bottom. Pipe the strawberry and pasilla paste into the rosehip halves, and place 2 coriander seeds into each of the rose hip halves, then slice those rose hiphalves in half to form 4 qu arters, each filled with paste and seed. Once you’re set with the 4
7. quarters, take the halved noble fir cone scales, and place both halves over the strawberry pas
8. aste to form a little roof. Place a raw pumpkin seed over the top of each quarter to form a
9. plateau and reserve. During service, marinate the berry quarters in rose oil and season them with salt.
10. Slice the quince into 1 mm thick slices of the whole face of the fruit and remove any seeds. Reserve.
