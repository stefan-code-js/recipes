## Method

1. As successful as this is as an amuse, it is an equally amazing hors d’oeuvre. I came up with this recipe one day when we were fooling around with cubed Cheddar cheese and trying to imagine what other foods would cut neatly into cubes. One of my cooks, Jason Wheeler, suggested tuna and all of a sudden our fun morphed into an outstanding amuse. The cubes of raw tuna look contemporary on the plate and the toasted sesame seeds enhance their flavor. Like cheese cubes, you could serve a whole tray of these at your next party, lined up geometrically and pierced with fancy toothpicks or cool-looking olive swords.
2. tablespoon mixed black and white sesame seeds
3. Put the sesame seeds in a dry frying pan and toast over medium heat for about 30 seconds or until fragrant and the white seeds start to turn golden. Transfer to a small, shallow bowl and allow to cool completely.
4. Cut the tuna into six ½-inch cubes.
5. To serve, coat one side of each cube with the sesame seeds and place on a small plate with the coated side facing up. Drizzle soy sauce and sesame oil over the cubes.
