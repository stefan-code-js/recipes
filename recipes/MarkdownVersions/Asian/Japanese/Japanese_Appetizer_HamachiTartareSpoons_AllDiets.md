2. Mound some tartare mixture in the bowl of a large dessert spoon or another decorative spoon. Using a second spoon of the same size, form the tartare into an oval, or quenelle. Remove the top spoon. The tartare will be served on the first spoon.
3. To serve, spread a thin layer of crème fraîche over the tartare and garnish with some of the hijiki. Repeat to make 5 more spoons. Arrange the spoons on a mirror.
