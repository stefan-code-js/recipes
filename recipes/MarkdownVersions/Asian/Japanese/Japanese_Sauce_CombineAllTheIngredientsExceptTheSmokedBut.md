## Method

1. well incorporated. Then proceed to add the butter and mix everything together well. Keep it
2. emulsified but melted during service.
3. tamis. Gently grill the nettles over coals on the barbecue until the leaves become crisp but not
4. colored brown. Transfer the nettles to a C -fold towel -lined container to absorb any excess fat.
5. Reserve in a low -temperature dehydrator.
6. Cooked beets
7. At the beginning of the seating, begin slicing the cooked beets, the turnips, and zucchini to a thickness of 2 to 3 mm on a Japanese mandolin. Punch out the slices of turnips in equal
8. quantities with 10, 12, and 15 mm ring cutters. Brush the grilled flatbread lightly with brown
9. butter and pipe on 1 g of black currant wood fudge in a zigzagging pattern. Season the crisp with3 small dollops of the morita chile paste. Add 1 g of the cep duxelles onto the crisp and 5 blackcurrant shoot halves.
10. Place the sliced vegetables into a strainer over a saucepot. Bring another saucepot of the lactokoji water emulsion up to a simmer and pour it over the sliced vegetables. The heating of the zucchini and beets is rather straightforward, but care should be taken with the white turnips toheat them through without overcooking them, so they retain a juicy and fresh snap without tasting like a fully cooked root vegetable. Empty the contents of the strainer out on a tray lined
11. with parchment, spreading everything out, and se ason the vegetables with salt.
12. Dress the flatbread with 5 or 6 slices of zucchini, 3 slices of the turnips, and 2 or 3 slices of the
13. beets (being sure to include both colors). Working from the outside in, arrange the vegetables
