9. of all understand that more than just taste should be considered. The senses of sight, smell, taste, and touch all come into play. The fifth sense, hearing, also plays a role, as when we react to the sizzle of a steak or the crunch of a potato chip, but this sense is less of a concern for the cook than the other

11. all of these factors are important to making a dish appealing to the diner. The discussion in this
12. section, however, is concerned mostly with aroma and taste. Why not just taste? Taste buds on the
13. tongue perceive only four basic sensations: salty, sweet, bitter, and sour (but see sidebar). What we
14. think of as flavor is a combination of taste and aroma. When the sense of smell is lacking, such as when you have a cold, foods seem to have little flavor.
15. vors. The primary flavors are the flavors of the main ingredients. for example, in blanquette of veal
16. () the primary flavor is veal; the primary flavors in calf’s liver lyonnaise () are liver and
17. onions; and the primary flavors in irish lamb stew () are lamb, onions, leeks, and potatoes.
18. These are the flavors that predominate. When you taste each of these dishes, the first tastes you
19. encounter are the main ingredients. o ther flavors, which we can call supporting flavors, support

21. begin to understand the general principles involved.
22. let’s look more closely at the recipe for blanquette of veal. Veal, by itself, does not have a strong or
23. pronounced flavor. Unlike meats such as beef or venison, veal has a mild, subtle flavor. i n this recipe,
24. the veal is simmered, so the flavor is even milder than it would be if the meat were browned by roast -
25. ing, sautéing, or braising. f or this reason, when choosing seasonings and other supporting flavors,

30. ities have recently identified a fifth, called umami, which has long been recognized by Asian cultures. Sense receptors on the tongue react to certain amino acids
31. (). Because amino acids are com-ponents of proteins, this taste is strong in foods high in protein. In fact, umami is often translated as “meatiness.” Beef, lamb, certain cheeses, and soy sauce are espe-
32. cially high in umami. The food additive
33. monosodium glutamate (MSG), used as a seasoning or flavor enhancer in some Asian cuisines, produces strong umami.
