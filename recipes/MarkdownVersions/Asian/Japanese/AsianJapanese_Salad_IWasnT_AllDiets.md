## Method

1. from Graubünden, bratwurst from St. Gallen,
2. from Basel. Even the town I grew up in was famous for its humble carrot cake,
3. I wanted to discover the true native originals of this city and its varied neighborhoods; to distinguish between the food that was genuinely local and food that was just locally available. I began to notice that in my restaurant and others, we were celebrating the cuisine of any place
4. here. Eleven Madison Park was, by all means, a very good restaurant. I was proud of what we were doing-but it was a fine-dining restaurant that just
5. Manhattan. We needed direction.
6. One night after service, Will and I sat down for a much-needed, late-night bite at a diner on Park Avenue. After a greasy cheeseburger, some war stories from the evening, and too many French fries, it was time to head home. We were paying the bill at the register when Will noticed the plastic-wrapped black and white cookies on the counter.
7. “I grew up with these,” he said nonchalantly, but I noticed a childlike grin spreading across his face. He bought one and insisted I try it. “Delicious, no?” he asked.
8. I didn’t want to hurt Will’s feelings, but the cookie wasn’t good at all: very doughy and dry, so sweet it made my teeth hurt. Yet, there was something about the
9. of that cookie-and Will’s nostalgic enthusiasm. This cookie, I learned, was a big part of the city’s food culture.
10. My first black and white inspired me to dig in. I wanted to soak up the true, local cuisine. I skipped invitations to fancy dinners in Midtown, spicy bowls of noodles, and sushi for a while and instead immersed myself in bagels and bialys, oysters and smoked fish, hot dogs and pastrami, pretzels and egg creams. These may be considered ordinary and accessible foods to some, but to me, they were totally new. What an opportunity to be inspired!
11. So, back to the cookie: true to its name, the black and white is a cake batter cookie glazed half with vanilla icing, half with chocolate. It was invented in upstate New York but has since migrated to all five boroughs and can now be found in almost every bakery, deli, and diner, as well as at Eleven Madison Park, where every meal begins with these iconic treats.
12. Our cookie, however, is a twist on the original: a savory version made with local cheddar and apples. Even though we’ve manipulated the flavors, our cookies are still served in the same white boxes you’d find in a local bakery, tied cleanly with a length of striped ribbon. I love to watch our guests react to this course at the start of their meal. Those who grew up here are filled with nostalgia and comfort; those passing through our town are still excited to open what is, in effect, a present.
13. This simple cookie offers a bit of nostalgia, a bit of surprise, a warm embrace from the kitchen, and above all, a delicious and comforting bite. It captures what our restaurant is all about.
14. My roots may be in Switzerland, but my heart is here, in the Big Apple.
15. Preheat a convection oven to 163°C/325°F, low fan. In the bowl of a stand mixer fitted with the paddle attachment, cream the butter on medium speed until soft, about 2 minutes. Add the cheese and mix on low speed. Slowly stream in the oil, being careful to maintain the emulsion. Separately, combine the salt and flour in a mixing bowl. Once the cheese and oil are fully incorporated, add the salt and flour mixture in 3 additions. Continue to mix on low speed until the flour is almost fully incorporated. Raise the speed to medium-high and mix until completely smooth. Place the dough between 2 sheets of parchment paper and roll to 2 mm (
16. inch) thick. Refrigerate until firm, about 30 minutes. Using a 3.5 cm (1⅜-inch) ring cutter, punch rounds from the dough and lay out in a single layer, evenly spaced, on 2 baking sheets lined with nonstick baking mats. Freeze the rounds until frozen, about 15 minutes. Place another nonstick baking mat on top of the rounds and bake for 12 minutes, turning the pan once. Remove the top baking mats and let cool to room temperature on the baking sheets. Reserve in a dry, airtight container for up to 3 days.
17. Prepare an ice bath. In a small mixing bowl, whisk the egg yolks, cornstarch, and salt together to combine. In a saucepan over medium heat, bring the milk to a simmer. Remove the milk from the heat and whisk one-third into the egg mixture to temper. Slowly whisk the egg mixture back into the remaining milk mixture. Bring to a boil, whisking constantly, until the starch has cooked out and the mixture has thickened, about 10 minutes. Remove the mixture from the heat and whisk in the cheese and butter in thirds until fully incorporated, being careful to maintain the emulsion. Cover the pastry cream with a layer of plastic wrap directly on the surface and chill over the ice bath.
18. In a saucepan over medium heat, melt the cocoa butter. Once melted, add the black cocoa replacer and salt. Mix until fully incorporated and then transfer the cocoa butter mixture to a small mixing bowl. Using an immersion blender, slowly add in the softened butter. Blend until smooth, being careful to maintain the emulsion. Keep at room temperature.
19. In a saucepan over medium heat, melt the cocoa butter. Once melted, add the salt and transfer the cocoa butter mixture to a small mixing bowl. Using an immersion blender, slowly add in the softened butter and white cocoa butter. Blend until smooth, being careful to maintain the emulsion. Keep at room temperature.
20. Spread half of the cookies out in a single layer on a baking sheet lined with parchment paper. In the bowl of a stand mixer fitted with the paddle attachment, whip the pastry cream on high speed until smooth, about 2 minutes. Transfer the pastry cream to a piping bag fitted with a #802 pastry tip. Pipe the pastry cream in a complete ring onto each of the laid-out cookies. Transfer the lady apple puree to a piping bag and pipe into the center of each ring of pastry cream. Set aside. Make sure both glazes are the consistency of melted chocolate. It may be necessary to microwave or refrigerate the glazes to achieve the proper consistency. Dip 1 of the remaining cookies into the white glaze, coming about three-quarters of the way up the cookie. After dipping, tap the cookie gently on the edge of the mixing bowl to eliminate any air bubbles. Drag the cookie along the rim of the mixing bowl to remove any excess glaze. Place the dipped cookie on a baking sheet lined with parchment paper, pushing slightly from the unglazed side to prevent the glaze from pooling and forming a foot. Repeat with the remaining cookies. Refrigerate the cookies until the glaze is just set but before the glaze gets too cold and cracks. Using a gloved hand, hold the white-glazed side of the cookie and repeat the process with the black glaze, coming halfway up the cookie. Move quickly to prevent leaving a fingerprint on the white glaze. Refrigerate the black and white glazed cookies until the glaze is set. Top each filled cookie with a glazed cookie to finish.
21. was nine years old, I was fortunate enough to visit the Musée de l’Orangerie, an extraordinary museum of impressionist painting in Paris. The museum sits at the eastern end of the Champs-Élysées, next to the Place de la Concorde, and was originally constructed as a shelter for the orange trees of the Tuileries Gardens. In the early twentieth century, visionary artist Claude Monet petitioned the French government to donate a series of works to commemorate the end of the Great War. Since the Orangerie had recently been repurposed as a museum, government officials happily suggested that Monet create his installation there.
22. changed my life. Even if you only have a casual interest in or knowledge of art, you likely know about these paintings and have heard of their beauty.
23. the Orangerie is that the museum itself was designed with Monet’s input, specifically for the installation. He worked with the architects to design the shape and scale of the room, along with its finishes. But most important, he advised on the lighting, which is all natural, yet diffused to the artist’s specifications.
24. As I stood before the paintings as a child, they fully enveloped me. I remember not knowing whether I should be happy-joyous even-or whether I should cry. Even at that young age, I felt I understood on some level that art is tangible; it was affecting. Seeing that perfect work in the perfect setting-the apex of art and space working in tandem-started me on a different path. Suddenly, I knew that art was important, and I felt I needed to know more. As I studied Monet and his work, I discovered two important ideas. The painting is beautiful in and of itself. It could stand alone, as a singular work of aesthetic beauty, for an eternity. But what’s more important is how
25. changed art. I learned that great art pushes all art forward. At the time, Monet was painting in a style that would come to be known as abstract expressionism-but this was some sixty years before the art world even had a descriptor for what he was doing. It was only after the first wave of true abstract impressionists in America became popular that people began to realize Monet’s importance and genius. (To think, the Orangerie had been used as a military storage facility during the occupation of Paris in World War II; no one cared about the masterpieces hanging behind the crates of guns and ammo.) Art began to shift.
26. I was taken aback by its beauty-instantaneously and fully. But now, thirty years later-as I learn more about Monet’s life and career, as I consider his motivations and choices, and as I view the panels again and again-I still find new ways to appreciate it. It strikes me as powerful that one creation from one person has the opportunity, the ability, to affect so many. I remember how Monet’s work made me feel-and wonder at the sheer number of others who have been similarly touched. It fills me with joy.
27. I imagine that, for the painter, aesthetic beauty is the primary goal. For me, as a chef, the deliciousness of the food is akin to the artist’s goal. But I also know that there’s a bit more to it than that-a story, a season, an idea. If the only thing you know about my food is that it tastes delicious, and that pleases you-I couldn’t be happier. But if you’d like to know more, to just maybe appreciate it on a slightly different level, as I did Monet’s work, then that’s about the most honoring thing there is.
28. Monet has famously said, “I perhaps owe having become a painter to the flowers.” I sometimes wonder if a part of me perhaps owes becoming a chef to the painter.

30. This course could be served nowhere but in the Eleven Madison Park dining room. The original art deco sconces that hang from our vaulted ceilings inspired this presentation; it’s an attempt to connect the guest, the course, and the room together.
31. 0.5 g salt
32. Bring a pot of water to a rolling boil and prepare an ice bath. Gently lower the eggs into the boiling water and cook for 10 minutes. Drain the eggs and shock in the ice bath. Peel and coarsely chop the eggs. Spread the eggs in a shallow baking dish in an even layer and cold smoke with the applewood chips for 40 minutes. Remove the eggs from the smoker. Wrap tightly with plastic wrap and refrigerate for 1 hour. Smash the eggs with a fork and mix with mayonnaise and miso. Season with the lemon juice and salt. Keep refrigerated.
33. g salt, plus more for blanching
34. Combine the water and salt in a bowl and stir to dissolve the salt completely. Set the brine aside. Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a rolling boil over high heat and prepare an ice bath. Cut the tips of the asparagus so that they are 6 cm (2⅜ inches) long. Nib the asparagus tips and blanch in the boiling water until tender, about 4 minutes. Remove the asparagus with a spider strainer and shock in the ice bath. When cool, drain the asparagus and pat dry. Using a paring knife and a small clay sculpting loop tool, carve out a cavity in the stalk of the asparagus 1.6 cm (⅝ inch) long and 5 mm (
35. inch) wide. Using a chamber vacuum sealer, compress the hollowed-out asparagus tips in the brine. Drain and keep refrigerated.
36. inch) thick. Punch each egg yolk with a 3.5 cm (1⅜-inch) ring cutter. Fill the cavity in each asparagus tip with about 4 g of smoked egg salad and garnish with the mustard blooms. Drape 1 miso egg yolk-punch over the egg salad.
37. Using a vegetable peeler, remove the strings from the snow peas. Open the snow peas into the 2 “leaves.” Using a 6 mm (¼-inch) ring cutter, punch rounds from the snow pea leaves. Using a chamber vacuum sealer, compress the rounds in the chive oil in an open container.
38. Cut 2 suprêmes from the lemon and cut each suprême into 5 or 6 slices. Dress the snap peas with the lemon vinaigrette and season with salt. Divide the snap pea salad among 8 spoons. Place 1 lemon suprême slice on each snap pea salad. Divide the trout roe over the snap pea salad on each spoon. Place the chickpea garlic puree in a piping bag. Pipe the chickpea garlic puree over the salad and trout roe to cover. Drain the snow pea punches on a paper towel to remove any excess oil. Shingle the snow pea punches over the chickpea garlic puree to cover completely. Season with sea salt.
