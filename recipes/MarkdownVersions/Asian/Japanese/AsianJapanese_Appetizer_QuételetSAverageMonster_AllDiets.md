## Method

1. , the physically and morally average man, Quételet created a range of deviance from the average that positions all people either to the left or right of center and, truly, punishes those who find themselves occupying the extreme left or right of the statistical bell curve. They became
2. . How this inspired Marx, who cites Quételet regarding this concept of an average or normal man, is obvious: “Societal deviations in terms of the distribution of wealth for example, must be minimized,” he wrote in
3. One has to give some credit to the scientific establishment of Quételet’s day. They did not buy his arguments at once. The philosopher/mathematician/economist Augustin Cournot, for starters, did not believe that one could establish a standard human on purely quantitative grounds. Such a standard would be dependent on the attribute under consideration. A measurement in one province may differ from that in another province. Which one should be the standard?
4. would be a monster, said Cournot. I will explain his point as follows.
5. Assuming there is something desirable in being an average man, he must have an unspecified specialty in which he would be more gifted than other people-he cannot be average in everything. A pianist would be better on average at playing the piano, but worse than the norm at, say, horseback riding. A draftsman would have better drafting skills, and so on.
6. . In fact, an exactly average human would have to be half male and half female. Quételet completely missed that point.
7. , the law of errors, since one of its earliest applications was the distribution of errors in astronomic measurements. Are you as worried as I am? Divergence from the mean (here the median as well) was treated precisely as an error! No wonder Marx fell for Quételet’s ideas.
8. This concept took off very quickly. The
9. , and this with the imprimatur of science. The notion of the average man is steeped in the culture attending the birth of the European middle class, the nascent post-Napoleonic shopkeeper’s culture, chary of excessive wealth and intellectual brilliance. In fact, the dream of a society with compressed outcomes is assumed to correspond to the aspirations of a rational human being facing a genetic lottery. If you had to pick a society to be born into for your next life, but could not know which outcome awaited you, it is assumed you would probably take no gamble; you would like to belong to a society without divergent outcomes.
10. One entertaining effect of the glorification of mediocrity was the creation of a political party in France called Poujadism, composed initially of a grocery-store movement. It was the warm huddling together of the semi-favored hoping to see the rest of the universe compress itself into their rank-a case of non-proletarian revolution. It had a grocery-store-owner mentality, down to the employment of the mathematical tools. Did Gauss provide the mathematics for the shopkeepers?
11. Poincaré himself was quite suspicious of the Gaussian. I suspect that he felt queasy when it and similar approaches to modeling uncertainty were presented to him. Just consider that the Gaussian was initially meant to measure astronomic errors, and that Poincaré’s ideas of modeling celestial mechanics were fraught with a sense of deeper uncertainty.
12. Poincaré wrote that one of his friends, an unnamed “eminent physicist,” complained to him that physicists tended to use the Gaussian curve because they thought mathematicians believed it a mathematical necessity; mathematicians used it because they believed that physicists found it to be an empirical fact.
13. Let me state here that, except for the grocery-store mentality, I truly believe in the value of middleness and mediocrity-what humanist does not want to minimize the discrepancy between humans? Nothing is more repugnant than the inconsiderate ideal of the Übermensch! My true problem is epistemological. Reality is not Mediocristan, so we should learn to live with it.
14. The list of people walking around with the bell curve stuck in their heads, thanks to its Platonic purity, is incredibly long.
15. Sir Francis Galton, Charles Darwin’s first cousin and Erasmus Darwin’s grandson, was perhaps, along with his cousin, one of the last independent gentlemen scientists-a category that also included Lord Cavendish, Lord Kelvin, Ludwig Wittgenstein (in his own way), and to some extent, our überphilosopher Bertrand Russell. Although John Maynard Keynes was not quite in that category, his thinking epitomizes it. Galton lived in the Victorian era when heirs and persons of leisure could, among other choices, such as horseback riding or hunting, become thinkers, scientists, or (for those less gifted) politicians. There is much to be wistful about in that era: the authenticity of someone doing science for science’s sake, without direct career motivations.
16. Unfortunately, doing science for the love of knowledge does not necessarily mean you will head in the right direction. Upon encountering and absorbing the “normal” distribution, Galton fell in love with it. He was said to have exclaimed that if the Greeks had known about it, they would have deified it. His enthusiasm may have contributed to the prevalence of the use of the Gaussian.
17. Let me discuss here the extent of the damage. If you’re dealing with qualitative inference, such as in psychology or medicine, looking for yes/no answers to which magnitudes don’t apply, then you can assume you’re in Mediocristan without serious problems. The impact of the improbable cannot be too large. You have cancer or you don’t, you are pregnant or you are not, et cetera. Degrees of deadness or pregnancy are not relevant (unless you are dealing with epidemics). But if you are dealing with aggregates, where magnitudes do matter, such as income, your wealth, return
18. on a portfolio, or book sales, then you will have a problem and get the wrong distribution if you use the Gaussian, as it does not belong there. One single number can disrupt all your averages; one single loss can eradicate a century of profits. You can no longer say “this is an exception.” The statement “Well, I can lose money” is not informational unless you can attach a quantity to that loss. You can lose all your net worth or you can lose a fraction of your daily income; there is a difference.
19. This explains why empirical psychology and its insights on human nature, which I presented in the earlier parts of this book, are robust to the mistake of using the bell curve; they are also lucky, since most of their variables allow for the application of conventional Gaussian statistics. When measuring how many people in a sample have a bias, or make a mistake, these studies generally elicit a yes/no type of result. No single observation, by itself, can disrupt their overall findings.
20. I will next proceed to a sui generis presentation of the bell-curve idea from the ground up.
