## Method

1. Bring the water to a boil, add all the remaining ingredients to the boiling water, and remove
2. from the heat. Leave to infuse for 30 minutes, then strain. Reserve the strained liquid in the pot.
3. Combine all the ingredients together in an appropriately sized container. Reserve in the fridge.
4. Before service, remove the outer leaves of the cabbage and then separate each leaf of the cabbage. You can use almost every leaf from the cabbage, but if they get too pale in color, thenmove on to another head of cabbage. Lay the leaves flat and upside down on a cutting board. Cutting horizontally, use a sharp knife to remove about 0.5 cm from the back of the thick stemthat runs through the middle of each leaf.
5. Temper the fish for 20 minutes before steaming. In service, set a steam oven to 62°C (100% fan).Cook the fish in the steam oven on a rack for 10 to 12 minutes. Take the fish out of the steamer when it’s done and leave it to rest at room temperature, still wrapped, for at least 5 minutes.
