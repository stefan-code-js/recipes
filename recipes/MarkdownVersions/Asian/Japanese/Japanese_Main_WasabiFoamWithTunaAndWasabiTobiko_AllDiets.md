## Method

1. I love sashimi and sushi, which for me is as much about eating great raw tuna and shockingly hot wasabi-the pungent Japanese horseradish-as anything else. When the wasabi powder is mixed with heavy cream and a bit of honey and then aerated into a foam, it’s unbelievably luxurious with the thinly sliced tuna. The wasabi “caviar” looks like bright-green speckles on the plate. It’s nothing more exotic than tobiko, or flying fish roe, cured in wasabi horseradish so that it turns green and absorbs great flavor, and is sold in some Asian markets.
2. Unlike the familiar white horseradish, the wasabi horseradish root is green. It has thicker bark than white horseradish, which when peeled reveals green fibers. It’s sold in Japanese and Asian markets, very often alongside sharkskin graters. Buy one of these, too. When you grate fresh wasabi on them, the fibers dissolve into a juicy, wet paste, just as you want it.
3. Put the wasabi powder in a medium-sized bowl. Slowly pour in the heavy cream and whisk until the mixture is very smooth. Whisk in the honey and season to taste with salt. Set aside for 10 minutes to allow the flavors to develop.
4. Pour the wasabi cream into the chilled canister of a foamer. The amount will fill it about halfway. Charge with 1 or 2 charges. Chill for at least 1 hour before serving.
5. To serve, slice the tuna as thinly as possible and place on small plates. Season to taste with salt. Shake the foamer vigorously and place a little of the wasabi foam on each plate, next to the tuna. Garnish each serving with wasabi
