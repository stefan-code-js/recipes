## Method

1. top. Add one single drop of árbol chile oil, pipe the Japanese quince on top of the mulberry, and
2. season with a bit of salt. Brush the rose oil on the top and inside of the crispy ladybug leather.
3. sort of glue to stick the two together. The narrow part of the raspberry should be where the head of the ladybug is, and the bottom of the now completed ladybug should just be raspberry.Build the ladybug just before serving the beet juice.
4. Using an immersion blender, blend the geranium leaves into the filtered water until well mixed.Strain immediately. Transfer the liquid to a spray bottle. This should be done directly before service.
5. g Seasoned Beet Juice
6. Quickly wash the wild leaves, plants, and herbs. Bunch together in a large and wild bouquet. This should not look curated, but rather completely wild and overgrown. Keeping the serving mug in ice, add the geranium oil to it. Then pour in the portion of seasoned beet juice. Add thewild leaves, plants, and herbs to the mug so they are growing out of it. Spray the herbs and
7. leaves with 10 sprays of the geranium water spray. Place the ladybug amongst the leaves and
8. flowers in the mug. Serve immediately.
