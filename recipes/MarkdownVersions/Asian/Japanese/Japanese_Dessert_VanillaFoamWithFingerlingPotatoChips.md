## Method

1. Put the all-purpose potatoes in a large saucepan and add enough cold water to cover by at least 3 inches. Bring to a boil over high heat. Reduce the heat and simmer for about 15 minutes or until tender when pierced with a fork. Drain.
2. Pass the potatoes through a food mill and put in a large bowl. Split the vanilla beans and scrape the seeds into the potatoes and stir to mix. Season to taste with salt.
3. Put the water in a small saucepan. Gently drop the gelatin sheet into the water and let soften and bloom for about 5 minutes. Bring to a simmer over medium-high heat. Cook, stirring, for about 2 minutes or until the gelatin dissolves. Pour into the potatoes and stir to mix.
4. or fine-mesh sieve. Repeat 3 more times for a total of 4 passes so that the potatoes are very finely strained. Rinse the
5. or sieve between batches, if necessary.
6. Pour the puree into the chilled canister of a foamer. The amount will fill it about halfway. Charge with 1 or 2 charges. Chill for at least 1 hour before serving.
7. Pour the vegetable oil into a deep heavy saucepan to a depth of about 2 inches. Heat over high heat until a deep-frying thermometer registers 350°F.
8. Use a Japanese mandolin to cut the fingerling potatoes crosswise into 18 very thin slices. If you don’t have a mandolin, use a small sharp knife to cut very thin slices.
9. Gently pat the potato slices with paper towels. Drop the slices into the hot oil and fry for 1 to 2 minutes or until golden brown. Remove from the oil with a slotted spoon and drain on a double thickness of paper towels. Sprinkle with salt while still hot. Transfer the chips to a wire rack to cool.
10. To serve, set 3 potato chips on a small plate. Shake the foamer vigorously and place a little vanilla foam on the chips. Garnish each with a sprinkle of kosher salt and chopped mint. Repeat to make 5 more servings.
