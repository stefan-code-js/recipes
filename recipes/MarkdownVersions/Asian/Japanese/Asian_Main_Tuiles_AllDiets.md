## Method

1. As soon as these triangular tuiles are baked, it’s important to work quickly to wrap them around the cone mold while they are soft and pliable. The tuile recipes make far more cones than you will need, but not only is working with a smaller quantity of batter difficult, but the final product will not be as successful. Use the leftover batter to make crispy cookies.
2. Preheat the oven to 350°F. Line a half sheet pan with a silicone baking mat or grease and flour the pan and then line the pan with parchment paper. Have ready a 4-inch triangle mold and at least 1 metal or wooden cone mold.
3. Whisk the all-purpose flour, salt, white pepper, and almond flour together in a small bowl. Set aside.
4. In the bowl of an electric mixer fitted with the paddle attachment, beat the butter at medium speed until creamy. Add the sugar and honey and beat until the mixture is pale in color. Reduce the speed to low and add the dry ingredients, beating until combined. With the mixer on high speed, add the egg whites one at a time and beat until mixed. Beat the batter until very smooth.
5. Place the triangle mold on the prepared pan and spread a thin layer of batter in it. Remove the mold and repeat to make 5 more

9. Make additional cones with the remaining batter.
