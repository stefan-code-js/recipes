## Method

1. should taste primarily of tomato. p lain, unseasoned foods, however, usually taste a little bland and
2. flavor. The harmony of ingredient flavors and aromas the cook creates by combining ingredients
3. skillfully is sometimes called a flavor profile.
4. foods offer complex experiences for the senses. When composing a new dish, a cook must first
5. of all understand that more than just taste should be considered. The senses of sight, smell, taste, and touch all come into play. The fifth sense, hearing, also plays a role, as when we react to the sizzle of a steak or the crunch of a potato chip, but this sense is less of a concern for the cook than the other
6. four. c onsider how we perceive these characteristics of a dish:
7. • appearance (color and color contrast, shape, shine, arrangement on the plate)
8. all of these factors are important to making a dish appealing to the diner. The discussion in this
9. section, however, is concerned mostly with aroma and taste. Why not just taste? Taste buds on the
10. tongue perceive only four basic sensations: salty, sweet, bitter, and sour (but see sidebar). What we
11. think of as flavor is a combination of taste and aroma. When the sense of smell is lacking, such as when you have a cold, foods seem to have little flavor.
12. vors. The primary flavors are the flavors of the main ingredients. for example, in blanquette of veal
13. () the primary flavor is veal; the primary flavors in calf’s liver lyonnaise () are liver and
14. onions; and the primary flavors in irish lamb stew () are lamb, onions, leeks, and potatoes.
15. These are the flavors that predominate. When you taste each of these dishes, the first tastes you
16. encounter are the main ingredients. o ther flavors, which we can call supporting flavors, support
17. and enhance the primary flavors of the main ingredients.
18. begin to understand the general principles involved.
19. let’s look more closely at the recipe for blanquette of veal. Veal, by itself, does not have a strong or
20. pronounced flavor. Unlike meats such as beef or venison, veal has a mild, subtle flavor. i n this recipe,
21. the veal is simmered, so the flavor is even milder than it would be if the meat were browned by roast -
22. ing, sautéing, or braising. f or this reason, when choosing seasonings and other supporting flavors,

24. ities have recently identified a fifth, called umami, which has long been recognized by Asian cultures. Sense receptors on the tongue react to certain amino acids
25. (). Because amino acids are com-ponents of proteins, this taste is strong in foods high in protein. In fact, umami is often translated as “meatiness.” Beef, lamb, certain cheeses, and soy sauce are espe-
26. cially high in umami. The food additive
27. monosodium glutamate (MSG), used as a seasoning or flavor enhancer in some Asian cuisines, produces strong umami.
