## Method

1. do it in print is quite another. I knew that the most important aspect of this book
2. baking scenarios. Eric set up a password-protected blog and posted the photos
3. and text as I planned the material to be published.
4. Enlisting a group of a dozen committed test bakers, we supplied them
5. from their experience. Soon photos, personal accounts, and questions started
6. pouring in. A vibrant discourse ensued as many plunged into the project with
7. such consistently impressive results. Many testers made exceptional bread, judged
8. Tartine bread. Their bread gave us no reason to take into consideration that they
9. were making it at home, with no experience and without professional equipment.
10. building a leaven to make great bread.
11. A few testers started modifying the recipe to suit their schedules. Eric
12. and I, along with Nate Yanko, my lead bread baker at Tartine, and Lori Oyamada-
13. duction while continuing to assemble and test other recipes for the book. There
14. was no time to maintain the blog properly, and our testers went rogue. When
15. were what resonated the strongest: The grad student who had never baked before
16. made better bread than most commercial bakeries. The former chef and avid
17. home baker got results he had practically given up on. The first-time restaurant
18. owner decided that he wanted to make the bread for his cafe instead of buying it.
19. or experience you have. They innovated along the way, and we all became better
20. bakers for it.
