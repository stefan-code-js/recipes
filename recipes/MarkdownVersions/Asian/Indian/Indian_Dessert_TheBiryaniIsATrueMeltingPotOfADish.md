## Method

1. Make the seven-spice by grinding the whole spices and mixing
2. with the remaining spices. Reserve 1 tablespoon and store the rest.
3. Preheat the oven to 160°C (325°F/Gas 3). In a large, ovenproof pan, melt about 25g (1oz) of the butter and gently sauté the
4. chicken thighs with the cloves, star anise, and peppercorns. When
5. the chicken starts to turn opaque, cover with boiling water and bring to a simmer. Cook in the oven with the pan lid on for about an hour, until the meat is tender. T ake out the chicken and set aside.
6. Remove the spices from the liquid, then add boiling water to
7. fill the pan. Add the rice and a good pinch of salt. Boil for 7-8
8. minutes, until the rice starts to soften. While the rice is cooking,
9. shred the chicken, then line a large, heavy-based saucepan with baking paper. Drain the rice and rinse under the cold tap.
10. Heat 2 tablespoons of the oil in a frying pan and fry the garlic for less than a minute over a medium heat. Then add the ginger,
11. chilli flakes, 1 tablespoon of seven-spice, and a good pinch of sea salt. Add the chicken, followed by a little more oil and the diced aubergines. Stir fry for about 5 minutes, until the chicken and aubergine are coated in oil and spices. Season with salt and pepper.
12. Melt the remaining butter with a little oil, then pour into the paper-lined saucepan. Sprinkle with sea salt and add a thin layer
13. of rice, then a layer of chicken and aubergine mix. Repeat, alternating the layers and finishing with rice. Poke a few holes in the mixture with a wooden-spoon handle, to allow steam to rise through the dish.
14. Wrap the pan lid in a tea towel and put it on the pan. Cook over the lowest heat possible for 35-45 minutes. With 15 minutes to
15. go, add the peas to the pan. At the end of cooking, use a fork to check that the bottom layer of rice has formed a crust. If it has not, raise the heat and cook for up to 5 more minutes.
16. T o serve, flip the biryani onto a dish, so that the golden, crispy rice base - known in Persian as the tahdig - is on top. For a crispier crust,
17. omit the paper, but that ensure the rice does not burn while cooking.Serves 4-6
