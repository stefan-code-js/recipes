## Method

1. 3. Frequently, a small amount of liquid, such as equal parts wine and fish stock, is added. Just enough liquid is used to cover the fish about halfway or less. During baking, the fish is basted
2. 4. The fish may be baked uncovered or covered only lightly. It should not be covered tightly, how-ever, because the liquid must be able to reduce somewhat so it will become more concen -
3. trated and more flavorful. Remember also that liquid will be released from the fish, diluting the
4. cooking liquid.
5. 5. For service, the fish is removed from the dish. The liquid is strained, degreased, reduced, and finished in various ways, such as by adding butter, cream, or velouté sauce.
