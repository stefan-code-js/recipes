## Method

1. Heat a pot of oil on the stove to 170°C. Fry these chunks of fermented belly whole for 2½ minutes, until nicely caramelized, but not too dark. Once this caramelization is achieved, removefrom the oil, and allow to cool over C- fold towels. Once cool, wrap the fried pieces in C- fold
2. towels and transfer them to the fridge to cool and to allow the fat to set to make it easier to slice (approximately 30 minutes).
3. Once cool, transfer the fried belly to a cutting board and slice the meat lengthwise into 1.5 cmwide pieces. Each portion is 3 of these slices and should weigh a total of 9 to 10 g.
4. Over a white scale, lay your 3 slices of fried wild boar belly on a parchment square. Pipe a small
5. line of the smoked egg yolk sauce across the slices of belly, following the grain of the meat. Add1 gram of the diced roasted chestnuts to each slice of wild boar belly, using the smoked egg yolksauce as a sort of adhesive, so that the chestnuts stick. Fold each slice in half over the chestnuts,following the grain of the meat (folded from the bottom edge to the top edge). Lance each wildboar wrap on a metal skewer, puncturing the top part of the wrap. Each portion is 3 wild boar
6. wraps. Reserve these skewers in the fridge until service.
7. Leftover butter from the Roasted Chestnuts
8. Mix equal parts leftover smoked butter from roasting the chestnuts with freshly smoked butter.
9. Warm together in a pot and reserve on the BBQ for service.
10. g Roasted Kelp*
11. Set a barbecue to medium heat. Quickly toast the morita and ancho chiles over the charcoal,
12. almost as if you were toasting sheets of nori. Be careful not to burn the chiles. Once toasted, combine with the roasted kelp and the grapeseed oil and blend in the Thermomix on high for 3
13. econds, then turn it down to speed 7 and continue to blend for an additional 6 minutes and 30
14. seconds. After blending, transfer this chile paste base to a container and infuse in the fridge overnight. This is your chile paste base.
