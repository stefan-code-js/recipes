## Method

1. When I was a kid, my maternal grandmother, who was from Abruzzi, Italy, lived with us and regularly cooked polenta. When I got older and began taking cooking seriously, I discovered that southern grits were similar to polenta, both being “poor man’s foods.” As I started to eat my way around the world, one of the best grits dishes I had was with my friend Chef Dean Fearing at the Mansion on Turtle Creek restaurant in Dallas, Texas. Both grits and polenta are forgiving: It’s hard to overcook them and they carry a variety of flavors brilliantly. Here, I add Cheddar cheese to grits, as a play on the Parmigiano-Reggiano my grandmother might have used when cooking polenta. I tweak the flavor a bit by calling for fresh corn kernels to complement the corn grits. Because it is in season, I use butternut squash; this dish seems to belong in the winter. You could also add mushrooms, turnips, chicken or shrimp to make this a more substantial dish, or leave it as is: a small, hot amuse that will surprise and please your guests with its simplicity and humble origins.
2. butternut squash, peeled and diced (about 1 cup)
3. tablespoons grated Parmigiano-Reggiano cheese, plus more for garnishing
4. Cracked black pepper, for garnishing
5. In a large saucepan of boiling water, blanch the squash for about 5 minutes or until just tender. Remove with a slotted spoon and set aside to cool.
6. Let the water return to a boil and add the corn kernels. Blanch for 50 to 60 seconds, drain, and set aside to cool.
7. In a medium-sized saucepan, heat the milk, onion, and garlic over medium-high heat until scalding. Adjust the heat so that the milk simmers. Slowly add the grits, stirring with a wooden spoon until well mixed.
8. Cook over low heat, stirring constantly, for 12 to 15 minutes or until the grits reach the mush stage.
9. Remove the pan from the heat and stir in the cheeses and the chives. Season with salt and pepper.
10. To serve, arrange a mound of grits in a small bowl. Garnish with butternut squash and corn. Sprinkle Parmigiano-Reggiano cheese and cracked black pepper over the grits. Repeat to make 5 more servings.
