## Method

1. they are often cooked by braising and served in specialty items, like steak and kidney pie. Pork livers
2. Veal kidneys weigh 8-12 oz (225-350 g) each. Lamb kidneys are very small, 1½-3 oz (40-85 g)
3. each. i f you purchase whole lamb or veal carcasses, you will find a pair of kidneys inside the cavity,
4. the core area where the ducts emerge from inside the kidney.
5. Lamb kidneys are usually broiled and served two or three per portion, or as part of a mixed grill.
6. Butterfly them by splitting them almost in half, starting at the curved or convex side. spread them
7. open and skewer them to hold them open during cooking.
8. Veal kidneys can be broiled like lamb kidneys, but they are most often cut up, sautéed, and
9. served in a sauce. to prepare them for sautéing, first split them in half. r emove the white ducts from
10. the center. then cut into large dice or thick slices.
11. Cooking
12. there are two main pitfalls to cooking kidneys. First, they become tough and rubbery if over -
13. cooked. Properly cooked, they are pink in the middle and still tender and juicy. Cooking time is
14. second, they have a high moisture content, which can interfere with proper sautéing. m ake
15. sure the pan is very hot before adding the kidneys, and do not overcrowd the pan. Failure to do this results in kidneys that are boiled in their juices rather than sautéed.
16. to avoid overcooking when sautéing over high heat, do not try to brown the kidneys too
17. heavily. Brown them only lightly and remove them from the pan when they are still somewhat rare. set them aside while you deglaze the pan and prepare the sauce. d uring this time, some juices will
18. be released from the kidneys. drain this juice and add it to the sauce if desired, or discard it if you feel
19. the flavor is too strong. Finally, add the kidneys to the sauce and warm them gently. d o not let them
20. simmer long. s erve at once.
21. Sweetbreads are the thymus glands of calves and young beef animals. ( the gland gradu-
22. ally disappears as the animal matures.) they are considered a delicacy and are often expensive.
23. sweetbreads are mild in flavor and delicate in texture. they are usually braised or breaded and
24. sautéed in butter.
25. Before cooking, sweetbreads should be prepared according to the following procedure
26. 1. soak in several changes of cold water for several hours or overnight. this removes blood, which would darken the meat when cooked.
27. 2. Blanch in simmering salted water for 10 minutes. some chefs like to add a little lemon juice or vinegar to the water to preserve whiteness and make the meat firmer.
28. 3. refresh under cold water and peel off membranes and connective tissue.
29. 4. Press between two trays, with a light weight on top, and refrigerate for several hours. if desired,
30. wrap in cheesecloth before pressing, as shown in Figure 16.20.
31. 5. Prepare for cooking:
32. • For braising, leave whole or cut into large dice.
33. • For breading and sautéing, split in half horizontally. Pass through s tandard Breading
34. Procedure () or dredge in flour.
35. Brains are not a popular item, but they are delicate in both flavor and texture. Calf’s brains are the
