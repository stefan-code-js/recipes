## Method

1. Preheat the oven to 350°F and position a rack in the center of the oven. Line a jelly-roll pan or a large baking sheet with parchment paper.
2. In the bowl of an electric mixer fitted with the paddle attachment, combine 1¼ cups flour, sugar, and salt and mix at low speed until combined. Add the butter and mix until the mixture resembles coarse crumbs. Add the buttermilk and continue to mix until the liquid is absorbed and the dough starts to come together. Do not overmix.
3. Turn the dough out onto a lightly floured work surface. Shape into a disk. Wrap in plastic wrap and refrigerate for at least 1 hour or until firm enough to roll out.
4. Lightly dust the work surface and a rolling pin with flour. Roll out the dough into a very thin sheet, about ¼ inch thick, dusting the work surface and dough with additional flour as needed. Prick the sheet of dough all over with a fork. Transfer the dough to the prepared pan. Unless the work surface is dusted with flour, the dough might stick. Use a spatula or another tool to release it gently from the surface. Brush the dough with some of the egg white and sprinkle with salt and pepper.
5. Bake in the middle of the oven for 6 to 10 minutes or until golden brown. Transfer to a wire rack to cool completely. Break into irregularly shaped pieces to serve.
