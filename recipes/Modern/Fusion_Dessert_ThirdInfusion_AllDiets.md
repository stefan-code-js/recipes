## Method

1. ady inside of it. Have additional sprigs of lemon thyme and lemon verbena (and if need be,
2. another piece of smoked hen of the woods mushroom) if the finished broth needs a stronger infusion. Allow the herbs to infuse for 5 minutes. Strain the broth one more time, cool the smoked fish broth down, and reserve it in an airtight container in the fridge until needed.
3. Steam the crabs at 80°C for 20 minutes. Allow the crabs to cool, then pick the meat from the shells. Blend all the picked meat with filtered water at a ratio of 1:1 in the Thermomix, first at high speed for 1 minute and then at speed 6 set to 60°C for 30 minutes. Once blended, transferthe mixture while still hot to a vacuum bag buried in ice to cool the purée as rapidly as possible.
4. crab stock base from overflowing. Once sealed, double bag the initial vacuum bag to ensure it
5. doesn’t split open in the cooking process. Bring a rondeau of water up to a b oil, place the sealed
6. bag of crab purée into the water, and leave it to cook for 1 hour. The proteins will coagulate from the heat and separate from the liquid, clarifying the broth in the process. When finished,strain the liquid through a fine -mesh nylon sieve and chill it down over ice.
7. Freeze the citrus seaweed with liquid nitrogen and pulverize it in a Blendtec until powdered. Combine the powdered seaweed with the ethanol and transfer it to the sonicator. Sonicate themixture at 100% amplitude for 5 minutes while keeping the container c hilled over an ice bath.
8. Once sonicated, transfer the mixture to a rotovap set to full vacuum and 35°C until the evaporator flask runs dry. Reserve the distillate harvested from in the collection flask in an airtight glass container in the freezer until ne eded.
