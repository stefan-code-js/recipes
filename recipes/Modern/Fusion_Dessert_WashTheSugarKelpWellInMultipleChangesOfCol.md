3. as well. For each day, remove the kelp from the liquid before service and portion it into oblique,

7. and using tweezers if necessary to ensure it is free of dirt. For every 40 g of cleaned Irish moss,use 250 mL of the strained of the cucumber kelp broth and place both together in a sous vide bag, seal and then cook it at 90°C steam (100% fan) for approximately 30 minutes (most importantly, until the moss is tender). Once cooked, strain the moss from the cooking liquid immediately. The moss releases so much carrageenan that it will set the cooking liquid if it coolsdown even slightly.
