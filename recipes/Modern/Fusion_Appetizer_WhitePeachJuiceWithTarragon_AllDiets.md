## Method

1. While you can make seductively sweet juice with any perfectly ripe peach, white peaches have a special allure for many people. This is particularly true of my culinary partner, Gale Gand, who is crazy about them. Gale, who bakes with them whenever she can, introduced me to them very early in our relationship. Serving white peach juice as an amuse was inspired by her, and the addition of fresh tarragon, which kicks up the flavor of the peaches with a tinge of licorice, makes this a great favorite in the restaurant. Be sure the peaches-white or yellow-are very ripe; almost overripe peaches are best.
2. ripe white peaches, pits removed
3. or fine-mesh sieve into a small saucepan. Add the tarragon and bring to a simmer over medium-high heat. Reduce the heat and simmer gently for 10 minutes.
4. or fine-mesh sieve into a pitcher. Stir in the lemon juice. Allow to cool to room temperature. Cover and refrigerate for 2 hours or until chilled. Season to taste with salt and white pepper.
5. Stir before pouring into small, chilled glasses for serving.
