## Method

1. A tart crust can be pre-baked, or baked without a filling, which is called “blind baking.” To prevent the crust
2. shrinking in the oven, it is important not to stretch the pastry when you line it into the tart pan. The crust needs to be lined with baking paper and filled with weights (pie weights, baking beans, or dried beans that can be re-used). Weighing the pastry down is important when baking basic tart dough, but is not necessary for sweet and short pastries if you butter the tart pan (or ring) before lining it with the dough.
3. If chilling, cover the dough in several layers of plastic wrap or, if freezing, place it in a freezer bag, label, and date. Store in the coldest part of the refrigerator, well away from strong-smelling foods such as fish and cheeses. Adding a few drops of white vinegar or lemon juice to the dough will extend the storage time of basic and short pastries.
