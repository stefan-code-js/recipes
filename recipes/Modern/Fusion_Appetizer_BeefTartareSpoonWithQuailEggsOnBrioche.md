## Method

1. or from a good bakery
2. Using a 1-inch round cookie cutter, stamp out a round from each slice. Discard the bread centers or reserve them for another use. Lightly toast the bread after you cut it to keep it from crumbling.
3. Melt the butter in a small nonstick skillet or sauté pan over medium-low heat. Put the bread in the skillet.
4. One at a time, break the eggs into a small cup and slide each one into the hole in the bread. Alternatively, crack the eggs directly into the holes in the bread, but cracking them first into a cup means less breakage. Cook for 1 to 2 minutes or until the whites are set and the yolks are still runny.
5. To serve, use a slotted spatula to transfer the bread and eggs to 6 small plates. Divide the beef tartare into 6 equal portions and form into oval quenelles. Put each quenelle on a demitasse or dessert spoon. Place each filled spoon alongside each serving of quail egg on toast.
6. or very small dice
7. teaspoons drained capers, chopped
8. 1½ tablespoons finely chopped shallots
9. teaspoon finely chopped flat-leaf parsley
10. Put the beef, egg yolk, capers, shallots, mustard, parsley, zest, and Worcestershire sauce in a small bowl. Stir until well mixed. Season to taste with Tabasco, salt, and pepper.
11. Cover with plastic wrap and refrigerate (for up to 2 hours) until ready to serve.
