## Ingredients

- Commonly known as cream whippers, ISI canisters and their N

## Method

1. At Tru, we have found that we get the best results with half-filled canisters. The following recipes, which use the smaller canisters, usually need only one cartridge, but if the foam does not foam satisfactorily, just add another cartridge. For the 4 to 5 cups that these recipes yield, I begin with 1½ to 2 cups of liquid.
2. Follow the recipe instructions about chilling the canister both before and after it is filled. The colder, the better. At the restaurant, we hold the canisters on ice for about an hour before we spray the foam from them.
