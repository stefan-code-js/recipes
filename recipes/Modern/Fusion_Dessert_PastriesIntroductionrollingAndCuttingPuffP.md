## Method

1. Dissolve the salt in the water being used to make the dough or add a drop of white vinegar to the water to prevent the pastry from oxidizing. You will be able to refrigerate the dough for up to 3-4 days without it spoiling.
2. Puff pastry can be frozen for up to 2 months, if covered tightly with plastic wrap or put in a sealed freezer bag. If you freeze puff pastry, it is advisable to stop after 4 turns. Once defrosted in the refrigerator, give
3. the pastry a final turn before rolling it out and baking.
4. Unlike flaky doughs, these use yeast to activate the gluten contained in the flour, giving them their elasticity. They are best made with bread flour, which has a high gluten content.
5. Kneading is done in two stages. Start at low speed until all the ingredients are evenly combined and then increase the speed to medium to develop the gluten and incorporate air so the dough rises. Only knead until the dough is smooth and holds its shape, as excessive kneading will make it too elastic.
6. Fresh yeast is available from artisan bakers and some pizzerias but, if you are unable to buy it, active dried or quick-rise yeast can be substituted. Both are widely available but dried yeast is twice as strong as fresh so the quantity in recipes should be halved. Follow the package instructions as to usage. The recipes in this book suggest a very cool oven ( 75°F/25°C ) for rising doughs but it can also be done in a warm room.
7. It’s imperative not to let the dough get too hot when rising as yeast cells die at 130° F (55°C ).BRIOCHE DOUGH
