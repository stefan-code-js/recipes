## Method

1. Cooking time
2. Stand mixer fitted
3. with the paddle beater attachment
4. 7-in. ( 18-cm) tart ringCROQUEMBOUCHE
5. Preheat the oven to 400° F (210° C/Gas mark 6 ). Bring the milk, water, sugar, fleur de
6. sel, and butter to a boil in a saucepan. Remove from the heat and beat in the flour with a spatula. Return to a low heat, stir vigorously until the mixture pulls away from the sides of the pan, and then cook for an additional 2-3 minutes to dry out the dough.
7. Transfer to the stand mixer and gradually beat in the eggs. Beat until the dough is of dropping consistency but still firm enough to hold its shape. Spoon into the pastry bag fitted with the
8. ½-in. ( 10-mm) tip and pipe small choux puffs about 1 ¼ in. (3 cm)
9. in diameter. Bake, ideally in a deck oven, for about 20-25 minutes.
10. Reduce the oven temperature to 325° F (160° C/Gas mark 3) and toast the chopped
11. almonds on a baking sheet for 15 minutes, until golden. In the copper saucepan,
12. cook the water and sugar over low heat until the sugar dissolves, then bring to a boil, keeping the sides of the pan clean with a damp brush. Add the glucose syrup and cook rapidly over high heat to a blond caramel. Stop the cooking process and add the toasted almonds all at once, mixing in with a spatula. Gently reheat the saucepan so the nougatine is not sticking to it and then pour onto the silicone mat. Let cool slightly, then roll out the nougatine and cut into the desired shape (see assembling step below) .
13. In a saucepan, bring the milk to a boil with half the sugar and the vanilla bean and seeds. Whisk the remaining sugar with the egg yolks in a mixing bowl, add the cus -
14. tard powder, and mix well. Pour one-third of the boiling milk into the egg mixture, whisking continuously, then pour the mixture back into the saucepan and bring to a boil. Add the butter and chill as rapidly as possible in the refrigerator.
15. In the copper saucepan, cook the water and sugar over low heat until the sugar dissolves, then bring to a boil, keeping the sides of the pan clean with a damp brush. Add the glucose syrup and cook rapidly over high heat to a blond caramel.
16. Using the 7-in. (18-cm) ring as a guide, cut a round of nougatine the same size for the
17. base. Using a template, cut 2 half-moon shapes to make the sides. Spoon the pastry
18. cream into the bag with the ⅓-in. (8-mm) tip, fill the choux puffs (see technique ) and
19. glaze the tops with the caramel. Lay 1 nougatine half-moon flat on a work surface, stick
20. rows of choux puffs (caramelized side outwards) on it and another 2 rows on those.
21. Stick the other half-moon of nougatine on top. Stick the croquembouche upright on the nougatine base with caramel. Add decorations of your choice.Ingredients
