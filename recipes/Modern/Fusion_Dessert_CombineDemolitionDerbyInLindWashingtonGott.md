## Method

1. Protein content has long been a measure of marketability for wheat. The demand
2. from large, industrial bakeries for high-protein flour places a premium on wheat
3. with a higher percentage of protein. Protein content goes up as the plant gets

5. genetics of the variety of wheat and environmental factors like soil health than it is
6. by soil moisture content. So a harvest with lower protein content can have protein
7. of excellent quality. Bakers like me prefer lower-protein flour. I told them not to
8. worry about protein content on my account. Yes, they laughed-I’m not one of their
9. A bushel of wheat berries weighs 60 pounds. On stalks in the field you can see
10. cat-whisker hairs called awns. The combine cuts the stalks, threshes to separate out
11. the wheat berries from the seed heads, and then uses a blower and a rotary sieve to
12. separate the wheat from the chaff-and all of that happens very quickly. What you
13. get at the end of the process is a bin full of the marketable crop: bushels of wheat.
14. At delivery the wheat is graded for moisture content and cleanliness; farmers pay a
15. enough job separating the wheat from the chaff. For them, it’s not just a saying-a
16. reduction in grade can mean a big loss of money.
17. Wheat is trucked from the local grain elevators to a mill in Spokane, where it’s
18. combined with wheat harvested at other
19. Shepherd’s Grain farms and stored in silos.
20. It will be milled throughout the year into whole wheat and white wheat flours, then
21. bagged and shipped to distribution partners for final delivery. The red winter wheat

23. protein content will be around 10.5 percent. This is the white flour I buy. The dark
