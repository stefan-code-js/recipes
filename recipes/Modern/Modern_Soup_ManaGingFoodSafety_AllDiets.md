5. government-inspected meats, poultry, fish, dairy, and egg products.

7. 3. Use clean, sanitized equipment and worktables.
8. 4. Clean and sanitize cutting surfaces and equipment after handling raw poultry, meat, fish, or
9. eggs and before working on another food.
10. 5. Place only food items and sanitary knives or other tools on cutting boards. do not set food containers, tool boxes, or recipe books, for example, on cutting boards, as the bottoms of these
11. items are likely to be unsanitary.
12. 6. Clean as you go. don’t wait until the end of the workday. Keep clean cloths and sanitizing solu-
13. tion handy at your workstation and use them often.
14. 7. Wash raw fruits and vegetables thoroughly.
15. 8. When bringing foods out of refrigeration, do not bring out more than you can process in 1 hour.

### Cooking

29. if cooked foods are not to be served immediately or kept hot for service, they must be cooled quickly
30. so they do not spend too much time in the f ood danger Zone. the rate at which foods cool depends
31. on their total volume in relation to how much surface area they have to transfer heat away. i n other
32. words, a large batch of food cools more slowly because it has less surface area per unit of volume.
33. time of no more than 6 hours. the temperature range between 70°f (21°C) and 125°f (52°C) is the
