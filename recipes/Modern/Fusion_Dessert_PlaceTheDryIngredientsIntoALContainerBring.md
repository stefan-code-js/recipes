2. mushroom tea and bring the tea up to a boil. Once to temperature, reduce the heat, and allow the mixture to simmer for 10 minutes. Once simmered, strain the seeds, and spread them on a
3. towel -lined plastic tray and cool, uncovered, in the fridge. Once cool, transfer them to a
4. container and add 3% salt by weight. Thoroughly mix the seeds and salt, and reserve, covered, in
5. Cut the green zucchini lengthwise and brush with honey. Grill the zucchini with the cut side facing the heat of the barbecue until well caramelized. Once golden brown, remove from the heat and rest. Cut the grilled zucchini into a small dice just before service.
6. Remove the bee larvae from the freezer and thaw for at least an hour before cooking. Gently break apart the bee larvae into individual pieces.
