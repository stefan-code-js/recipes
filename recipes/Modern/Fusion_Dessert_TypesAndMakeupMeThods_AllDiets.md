## Method

1. MOLDeD COOKIeS
2. The first part of the procedure for molded cookies (steps 1 and 2) is simply a fast and fairly accurate
3. way of dividing the dough into equal portions. each piece is then molded into the desired shape.
4. This usually consists of simply flattening the pieces out with a weight. For some traditional cookies,
5. special molds are used to flatten the dough and, at the same time, stamp it with a design.
6. 1. Roll the dough into long cylinders about 1 inch (2.5 cm) thick, or whatever size is required.
7. (Refrigerate the dough if it is too soft to handle.)
8. 2. With a knife or bench scraper, cut the roll into 1-ounce (30-g) pieces, or whatever size is required.
9. 3. Place the pieces on prepared baking sheets, leaving 2 inches (5 cm) of space between them.
10. 4. Flatten cookies with a weight (such as a can) dipped in granulated sugar after pressing
11. each cookie.
12. A fork is sometimes used for flattening the dough, as for peanut butter cookies.
13. 5. Alternative method: After step 2, shape the dough by hand into desired shapes.
14. ICeBOX COOKIeS
15. The icebox method, or refrigerator method, is ideal for operations that wish to have freshly baked cookies on hand at all times. The rolls of dough may be made up in advance and stored. Icebox
16. cookies can easily be cut and baked as needed.
17. 1. scale dough into pieces of uniform size, from 1½ pounds (700 g), if you are making small
18. cookies, to 3 pounds (1400 g), for large cookies.
19. 2. Form the dough into cylinders from 1 to 2 inches (2.5 to 5 cm) in diameter, depending on the size cookie desired.
20. 3. Wrap the cylinders in parchment or waxed paper, place them on sheet pans, and refrigerate
21. 4. Unwrap the dough and cut into slices of uniform thickness. The exact thickness required depends on the size of the cookie and how much the dough spreads during baking. The usual
22. A slicing machine is recommended for ensuring even thickness. Doughs containing nuts
23. or fruits should be sliced by hand with a knife.
24. 5. Place the slices on prepared baking sheets, allowing 2 inches (5 cm) of space between cookies.
25. Bar COOKIeS
26. Bar cookies are so called because the dough is shaped into long bars, which are baked and then cut. After cutting, they may be baked again, as in the case of biscotti, which means “twice baked. ” Do
27. not confuse bar cookies with sheet cookies (see below), which are often called bars by consumers.
28. 1. scale the dough into 1¾-pound (800-g) units (1-pound units, or 500-g units, may be used for
29. smaller cookies).
30. 2. shape the pieces of dough into cylinders the length of the sheet pans. Place three strips on each greased pan, spacing them well apart.
31. 3. Flatten the dough with the fingers into strips about 3-4 inches wide and about ¼ inch thick (8-10 cm wide, 6 mm thick).
32. 4. if required, brush with egg wash.
33. 5. Bake as directed in the formula.
34. 6. After baking, while cookies are still warm, cut each strip into bars about 1
