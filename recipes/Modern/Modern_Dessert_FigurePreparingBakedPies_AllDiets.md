## Method

1. 3. Roll out the dough for the top crust.
2. 4. Perforate the top crust to allow steam to escape during baking.
3. 5. Moisten the rim of the bottom crust to help seal it to the top crust.
4. 6. Fit the top crust in place. Seal the edges together firmly and trim excess dough. An easy way to do this is to press the rim with the tines of a fork. Alternatively, the rim may be fluted. An efficient way to trim excess dough is to rotate the pie tin while pressing on the edges with the palms of the hands.
5. 7. Brush the top with the desired wash: milk, cream, eggs and milk, or water. Sprinkle with granulated sugar if desired.
6. 8. Place the pie on the lower level of an oven preheated to 425°-450°F (220°-230°C). The high initial heat helps set the bottom crust to avoid soaking. Fruit pies are usually baked at this high heat until done. For custard pies, reduce the heat to 325°-350°F (165°-175°C) after 10 minutes to avoid overcooking and curdling the custard. Custard pies include those containing large quan-tities of egg, such as pumpkin pie and pecan pie.
