## Method

1. Pork tenderloin, cut from the center loin, cooks quickly and tastes light and fresh. Buy pork with pinkish meat and firm white fat. Cook it just until a meat thermometer registers 150°F and then let it rest to avoid overcooking. I serve this amuse during the holidays, as its flavors blend perfectly with others of traditional celebratory meals. I have even served this on Thanksgiving and for many other holidays. I love pork-it truly is “the other white meat” in my kitchen. Thank you, Pork Council.

3. Peel, core, and cut 3 of the apples into very fine dice.
4. Strip the leaves from 1 of the rosemary sprigs and finely chop the leaves.
5. Melt the butter in a small sauté pan over medium heat. Add the diced apples, the chopped rosemary, and the cinnamon stick and cook for 1 minute. Set aside to cool. Discard the cinnamon stick. When cool, toss with the crumbs. Set the apple filling aside while you make the salad and prepare the pork.
6. Peel and core the remaining apple and then cut it into very fine dice. Put the dice in a small bowl.
7. Strip the leaves from the remaining rosemary sprig and finely chop them.
8. Add 3 tablespoons of the oil and the vinegar to the diced apple and toss. Season to taste with salt and pepper. Scatter the chopped rosemary over the apple and mix well. Set the salad aside.
9. Preheat the oven to 350°F.
10. Cut the pork lengthwise without cutting all the way through. Open up the pork and pound the meat to form a rectangle of even thickness. Spread a thin layer of the cooled apple filling down the center and fold over the sides to form a compact cylinder. Tie with kitchen string.
11. Heat the remaining 1 tablespoon oil in a small ovenproof sauté pan over medium-high heat until almost smoking. Sear the pork on all sides until well browned.
12. Transfer the pan to the oven and roast the pork for 8 to 10 minutes or until medium and an instant-read thermometer registers 150°F. Transfer the pork to a plate and allow to rest for 5 minutes.
13. To serve, slice the pork into 6 equal portions. Spoon some apple-rosemary salad on a small plate and place a slice of pork alongside. Repeat to make 5 more servings.
