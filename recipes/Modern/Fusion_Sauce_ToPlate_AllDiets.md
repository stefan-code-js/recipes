## Method

1. or 5 slices Cooked Wild Duck Breast
2. Smoked Madagascar Pepper, chopped
3. This main course is being served with the Foraged Plate- a sort of sidecar of forest nuts, berries,
4. and pine. Be sure that this is ready to go before plating the duck and its accouterments.
5. Just before service, chop the Madagascar peppercorns to a size that makes it easy to season th e
6. uck breast with them . Temper the wine leaves at least 30 minutes before service but leave the
7. When the duck comes in from the barbecue, use a very sharp knife to immediately remove the
8. breasts from the crown . Because we have removed the wishbone while butchering, your knife
9. will be able to follow the breastbone straight down, and we can maximize the amount of breastmeat we get closest to the neck. Once the breast is removed from the crown, slice the meat on
10. a slight bias -about 1 cm thick, against the grain. Cut from the top of the breast to the bottom
11. of it. Each portion will be 4 or 5 slices, serving the thickest slices (from the part closest to the
12. neck) before the thinner slices (from the part closer to the legs). Be wary of buckshot in the breasts, or any blood clots that may be in there due to buckshot. Push together the sliced portion of duck breast and spread a teaspoon of berry praline evenly over the top of it. Seasonthe meat with a bit of salt and t he chopped smoked Madagascar pepper. Send the seasoned
13. Once the meat is at the hot pass, plate the sliced and seasoned duck breast in the middle of th
14. propriate plate. Remove the blanched wine leaves from their vacuum bag (they should be
15. room temperature). Just before plating, spray the wine leaves with 3 or 4 sprays of pine vinegar.Retrieve the finished hazelnut feather and the finished truffle millefeuille. Heat the truffle sauceto approximately 80°C (hot, but not boiling). Stir the sauce to split the butter, add the choppedtruffles, and ladle 2 spoonfuls of hot sauce over the duck breast. When the breast is sauced, plate the wine leaf, the hazelnut feather, and the truffle millefeuille surrounding the sauce. Finish th e foraged plate and serve the two together.
