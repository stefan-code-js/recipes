## Method

1. levain needs to be mixed today. Measure out the amount needed from the first levain
2. mix, throw the rest away, and mix this feeding of the levain in the bread mixer.
3. Put a second fold in each tub of ciabatta dough.
4. Begin baking the baguettes, preferably a little earlier. We need baguettes
5. with a small amount of sliced ham and a slice of good
6. still very fresh). My biggest stress point is having the baguettes come out of the
7. round of morning deliveries. We can’t bag hot bread because it ruins it, causing the
8. crust to go limp from the bread’s own steam.
9. Finish baking the baguettes. Clean up around the oven and rack the
10. -while they rise. They absorb some of the
11. dampness of the bread dough, and it’s best to dry them out before using them again.)
12. Cut the ciabatta (my favorite dough to handle and bake) into loaves and
13. buns. Now that the 7 kilos of ciabatta dough in each tub has tripled in size, the
14. dough is sticking to the lids. Invert a tub onto the heavily floured baker’s bench and,
15. because I oiled the tubs so generously back at about 5:40 a.m., the dough pops right
16. out. The dough holds the shape of the tub, thanks to the folds I gave it during its rise.
17. loaves 14 to 16 inches long for retail and about 2½ feet long for restaurants. Put the
18. Sweep up around the bread bench. Mix the brioche dough.
