## Method

1. Cooking time
2. Stand mixer+ dough
3. butter, diced, at room
4. Knead all the pretzel dough ingredients in the bowl of the stand mixer on
5. low speed for 3 minutes until well combined. Increase the speed to medium
6. and knead for 10 minutes until the dough is supple and elastic. Make sure
7. the dough temperature does not exceed 75°F (24°C). Place in a clean bowl,
8. cover with plastic wrap, and let ferment for 15 minutes at room temperature.
9. Divide the dough into 8 pieces weighing 3.75 oz. (105 g) each and shape
10. each one into a ball. Let rest for 15 minutes at room temperature.
11. Shape each piece of dough into a mini-baguette shape (see technique ),
12. in. (15 cm) long, and place on a baking sheet lined with parchment paper.
13. above a bowl of boiling water, for 15-30 minutes, followed by 45 minutes
14. COOKING THE BUNS
15. Preheat the oven to 425°F (220°C/Gas Mark 7). Prepare the poaching liquid
16. by combining the water and baking soda in a large saucepan. Bring to a
17. boil and maintain at a simmer over low heat. Poach the pretzel buns in the
18. simmering water for about 30 seconds on each side. Remove with a slotted
19. spoon and return them to the parchment-lined baking sheet. Lightly whisk
20. the egg white and brush over the buns. Using the bread lame, score the tops
21. with diagonal slashes (see technique ) or lengthwise down the center. Bake
22. for 15-20 minutes. Let cool completely on a rack before filling.
23. Poach the sausages for 10 minutes in a saucepan of simmering water. Preheat
24. the broiler. Using the bread lame, cut the buns lengthwise down the center,
25. without cutting all the way through, and spread the cut sides with mustard.
26. Place the sausages in the buns and set on a baking sheet. Place under the
27. broiler for a few minutes. Drizzle with ketchup, sprinkle with fried onions,
