## Method

1. This dish looks complicated but is a breeze to make. I developed it to take the best advantage of the ever-changing selection of mushrooms we get at Tru from our many resourceful mushroom suppliers, but I also wanted to make a terrine easy enough to serve to 130 people as an amuse-a concern not shared by most home cooks!
2. This is not a layered terrine but rather a mosaic-style terrine, a technique that I think everyone can do. You pour the mixture into the terrine mold and you’re done. If for some reason the terrine doesn’t set up, scrape it into a bowl, add a few more softened sheets of gelatin, and start again. This is one of the beauties of mosaic terrines-it takes a lot to ruin them!
3. I use yellow chanterelles, white oyster mushrooms, orange lobster mushrooms, earthy brown morels and shiitakes. All are gorgeous, and when the terrine is sliced, the multitude forms a mosaic, almost like an Impressionist painting. The tiny drizzle of truffle vinaigrette kicks up the flavor. Supermarkets and greengrocers all over the country sell wonderful fresh mushrooms in all shapes and sizes. This is a great opportunity to try the unfamiliar or a sampling of your favorites.
4. tablespoons chopped flat-leaf parsley
5. Nonstick cooking spray
6. Minced fresh chives, for garnishing
7. Fleur de Sel or other high-quality sea salt, for garnishing
8. Wipe the mushrooms clean, using a small brush to rid them of dirt if necessary. Remove the stems from the shiitake and portabello mushrooms. Remove the gills from the portabellos. Julienne the mushrooms.
9. Fill a large bowl with cold water. Gently drop the gelatin sheets into the water, several at a time, until all are submerged. Let soften and bloom for about 5 minutes.
10. In a large saucepan, bring the stock to a simmer over medium-high heat. Using your hands, lift the gelatin sheets from the water and squeeze them gently between your fingers. Transfer the sheets to the hot stock. Stir gently until dissolved.
11. Meanwhile, combine the minced garlic and shallots with the parsley.
12. Put the mushrooms in a large bowl and scatter the garlic, shallots, and parsley over them. Pour the stock over the vegetables. Set aside for about 20 minutes to allow to cool to room temperature.
13. Lightly coat a long, shallow, 3-cup terrine mold (I use a collapsible mold that is 20 inches long and 2 inches wide) with nonstick cooking spray and line with plastic wrap, leaving 3-inch overhangs on the long sides of the terrine.
14. Lift the mushrooms from the gelled aspic with your hands or a large spoon. Spread in the terrine. Use your fingertips to push them into the bottom of the terrine in an even, tight layer. Spoon enough aspic over the mushrooms to reach the top of the terrine. Place the mold on a rimmed tray to catch any overflow of juices. Fold the overhanging ends of the plastic wrap over the top of the terrine and set a piece of foil-lined lightweight cardboard to fit inside the mold, on top of the plastic wrap. Place 2 or 3 weights, such as soup cans laid end to end, on top of the cardboard and refrigerate for at least 24 hours.
15. To serve, use the plastic wrap to lift the terrine from the mold. Unwrap and cut the terrine into ¼-inch slices. Lay 1 slice on a small plate, drizzle with truffle vinaigrette, and garnish with minced chives and a sprinkling of sea salt. Repeat to make 7 to 11 more servings.
