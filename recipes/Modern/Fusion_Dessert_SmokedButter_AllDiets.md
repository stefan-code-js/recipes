## Method

1. Cep and Chanterelle Spice Mix
2. Prior to service, temper the steamed mussels for 30 minutes.
3. Set a steam oven to 54°C. Melt the smoked butter and fill up small square containers about
4. halfway with the melted butter. Add the smoked pickled quail eggs to the melted butter; placethe containers, covered, in the steamer no more than 15 minutes prior to serving . Once warm,
5. remove the container of quail eggs from the steamer. Use a slotted spoon to remove an egg from the butter and place it so that it lays flat on its side on a cutting board. Use a very sharp knife to cut approximately 30% of the right side of the egg off. Do this very quickly so that the yolk doesn’t run out. Immediately after cutting the egg, place it in a quail egg carton so that thecut side faces up.
6. and then add 2 spoons of the kelp -Lapsang souchong tea to further steam and tenderize the
7. leaves. Once tender, transfer the leaves to a cutting board and chop fi ne.
8. Retrieve the tempered mussels, open the mussel lips and pipe in approximately 2 g of the smoked egg yolk paste along the bottom of the mussel. On either side of the smoked egg yolk (against the lips of the mussel), spoon in about 2 g total of the finely chopped and steamed greens. Place the warm and cut quail egg on top of the egg yolk paste so that the yolk of the quail egg is still facing up. Close the mussel lips so that they encapsulate the quail egg. Use
9. tweezers to place 1 piece of cold -infused k elp salt to the left of the quail egg inside the mussel
10. and pipe about 1 g of koji fudge to the right side of the quail egg inside the mussel. Season the
11. exposed quail egg yolk with 5 drops of the ancho chile paste and a bit of salt.
12. Retrieve the warm horse mussel shell for this serving. Brush the smoked spice butter to coat th
13. nterior of the shell. Add 1 additional teaspoon of the spiced smoked butter to the bottom of the
14. shell. Using a tea strainer, generously season all sides of the shell with the cep and chanterelle
15. spice mix. Place the stuffed mussel in the shell on top of the spiced smoked butter and serve immediately.
