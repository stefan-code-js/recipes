## Method

1. Bake for 12 to 15 minutes, until the crust is golden brown and the dough is
2. baked all the way through, checking the pizza after 10 minutes and keeping a close eye on
3. it during the last 5 minutes of baking.
4. 5. Slice and serve
5. Remove the skillet from the oven and place it on a heatproof
6. surface. Carefully use tongs or a fork to transfer the pizza to a cutting board. Slice and
7. serve immediately.
8. with toppings. I’ve provided a few ideas below, but the possibilities are limited
9. only by your imagination. You want Hawaiian? It’s okay by me. Bake these in a
10. 525°F (274°F) oven, or as hot as your oven gets if less than 525°F (274°F).
11. to 12 slices salami
12. top focaccia with split red grapes and pine nuts. The grapes bake beautifully, their
13. sweetness offset by the cheese and salami that crisps while it bakes. Top the dough
14. with the cheese, salami, oregano, pepper, and grapes, and bake for 15 to 20
