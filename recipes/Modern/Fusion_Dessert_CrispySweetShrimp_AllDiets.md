## Method

1. Place the chamomile oil into a sauté pan set to medium -low heat on the stove and add the
2. angelica and meadowsweet. Bloom them briefly and then add the gooseberries and allow them
3. to break down and sweat. Add the rose hip flesh and stew the whole mixture down for about 30
4. minutes, until it thickens. Once cooked, pass the mixture through a tamis lined with a fine- mesh
5. nylon sieve. Once passed, spread it onto a silpat through the shrimp stencil, which is compose d
6. of the body of the shrimp and the 5 differently sized segments of its abdomen. Let the leatherdry at room temperature overnight
7. Peel the dried juniper berries of their skin, forming a small sheet. Cut 2 small circles of the juniper berry skin and reser ve them -they will serve as the eyes of the shrimp.
8. Once the leather is dry, fold the body piece in half thereby creating a cavity to be stuffed. Use asmall amount of the rose hip paste as adhesive to glue its horn and its tail shut (it should look like a shrimp). In descending order of size (from largest to smallest), use a bit of the rose hip
9. paste as adhesive to glue the abdominal segments together, shingling them as you go. Fold theshingled segments over the body of the shrimp. Place the juniper berry rounds on the shrimp’s
10. head to make the eyes. Roll up a small piece of plastic wrap and stuff it inside the shrimp’s
11. cavity to maintain the vacant space. Using a needle, pierce the shrimp through its side, and stick
12. that needle into a piece of Styrofoam s o that it sits suspended in midair. Transfer the whole set
13. up to a dehydrator set to 60°C to dry the shrimp leather overnight until crisp. The following day,carefully reserve the dried shrimp in an airtight container until needed.
