## Method

1. This bread involves feeding the levain two times, just a few hours apart, before mixing
2. Tartine Bakery when I
3. was learning to be a baker. The idea is to build up an active population of yeast in the
4. of sour flavors. You may notice a larger amount of levain here than in the other bread
5. it into the dough mix. A long, slow fermentation, followed by retarding the loaves
6. overnight in the refrigerator, creates a bread with an excellent, sweetish levain flavor.
7. The first time I baked this bread in my home kitchen, I thought, “Oh yeah, this is really
8. good.” It has a slight musky levain odor to its crumb and a gentle warmth of fermentation
9. flavors that I find very pleasant, especially in the crusty slices.
10. When you are ready to mix the final dough, I recommend sticking your nose in the
11. levain bucket and taking in a big, deep draft of its odor. It smells great. Almost, but not
12. quite, kind of like beer, with a slight edge of sour wheat. I wish I had the words.
13. THIS RECIPE MAKES 2 LOAVES, EACH ABOUT 1½ POUNDS.
14. Feed the levain at 7 a.m., feed it again at 10 a.m., mix the final
15. dough between 2 p.m. and 3 p.m., shape into loaves at 8 p.m., proof the
16. loaves in the refrigerator overnight, and bake around 8 to 10 a.m. the next
17. Whole wheat
18. Whole wheat flour
