## Method

1. Kamut (kah moot), like farro, is an ancient relative of wheat. i t is similar to spelt in composition
2. Buckwheat is technically not a grain because it is the seed not of a grass but of a plant with
3. branched stems and broad, arrow-shaped leaves. Whole buckwheat is often ground into flour. When
4. the grains are crushed into coarse pieces, they are called buckwheat groats and can be cooked
5. like rice. toasted buckwheat is called kasha. the toasting gives it a nutty flavor. Kasha is popular in
6. eastern e uropean and Jewish cooking. Kasha is also cooked like pilaf ().
7. Barley is usually purchased as pearled barley, which has been milled to remove the outer bran
8. layers. i t is commonly used in soups, but it can also be cooked by the pilaf method and served like
9. rice, although it has a longer cooking time.
10. Oats are most familiar in n orth a merica as a breakfast food. Steel-cut oats are whole grains
11. that have been cut into small pieces, somewhat resembling cracked wheat. they are usually cooked
12. as a porridge. Rolled oats are whole grains that have been steamed until soft and then flattened
13. between rollers. this processing reduces their cooking time considerably. if they are cooked and
14. not just softened during the steaming process, they become instant oats. these need no additional
15. cooking, only reconstituting with boiling water.
16. Millet is a small, round yellow grain that is an important food source in much of a frica and a sia.
17. it has a high protein content and a mild flavor. m illet is often used as bird seed in north a merica.
18. it can be cooked like rice.
19. become a common feature of north a merican menus. Quinoa is high in
20. good-quality protein and lower in carbohydrates than other grains. i t is
21. a tiny, round grain with an ivory color and a mild, delicate flavor. When cooked, the germ of the grain unwinds, making it look as though each
22. grain has a tail. Before cooking, quinoa must be washed and rinsed well to remove a bitter coating that occurs naturally on the grain.
23. Triticale is a high-protein hybrid of wheat and rye. i t is often ground
24. into flour, but it can also be cooked whole like rice. triticale has a nutty,
25. flavor when cooked. i t contains high-quality protein and thus is useful in
26. a grass. Flax has recently gained popularity because it is thought to have some health benefits due to its beneficial fiber as well as a high quantity
27. of omega-3 fatty acids (). the seeds are used mostly in small
28. quantities in breads and in commercial breakfast cereal preparations.
29. consuming them in large quantities can cause digestive problems.
30. store raw grains at room temperature in a dark, dry place and in a tightly sealed container to keep
31. out moisture and insects. milled grains such as white rice that have had the germ removed will keep
32. for many months. Whole grains are somewhat more perishable because the fat content of the germ can become rancid.
33. depending on the source, whole grains may need to be picked over like dried beans (see )
34. to remove foreign matter such as tiny stones or bits of soil. i n addition, whole grains usually should
35. be washed and drained before cooking.
36. rice, our most commonly cooked grain, should be rinsed in cold water before boiling or steam -
37. ing. this removes the excess starch that makes it sticky. the rice industry recommends not washing
38. rice because it removes some of the vitamin coating of enriched rice. But that’s probably a small price to pay for a more attractive product. this is a decision you will have to make in your own operation.
39. do not buy low-grade rice, which tends to be dirty, or rice that has been coated with talc.
40. rice cooked by the pilaf method () does not need to be washed (unless it is dirty) because
41. the fat coating each kernel helps keep the grains separate and reduces stickiness.
42. converted rice and instant rice do not need to be washed.
43. top row: quinoa, triticale, pearl barley. Bottom row: blue cornmeal, pozole,
44. bulgur wheat.
