## Method

1. My six-year-old son, Gio, is the world’s biggest melon fan. He eats it almost every day for breakfast, although he prefers watermelon and “orange melon” to “green melon.” Still, when he eats green honeydew, he greedily drinks the juice in the bottom of the bowl, which got me started experimenting with melon juices. I tried a number of variations but finally came up with this simple mixture of honeydew juice and pink peppercorns. The peppercorns cut through the melon’s sweetness, and when you strain the juice, pleasing pale-pink streaks remain in the refreshing juice.
2. or fine-mesh sieve into a bowl.
3. Spread the pink peppercorns in a small dry skillet and toast over medium-high heat for 40 to 50 seconds or until they are fragrant. Transfer to a plate to stop cooking and allow to cool completely.
4. Stir the cooled peppercorns and the lime juice into the melon juice and set aside for 30 minutes to allow the flavors to develop.
5. or fine-mesh sieve lined with cheesecloth into a large pitcher. Cover and refrigerate for 2 hours or until chilled. Season to taste with salt and pepper.
6. Stir before pouring into small, chilled glasses for serving.
