## Method

1. When I can, I serve green-lipped mussels for this amuse, which I remember eating in New Zealand with great fondness. Years ago, when I was still with Trio, the owner of an Auckland restaurant called Cin Cin on Quay walked into my kitchen and offered me the opportunity to spend three weeks in New Zealand as a guest chef. When the plane tickets arrived, I was there! After ten days of cooking, and training the Cin Cin staff, I spent the remainder of the visit touring the gorgeous countryside, and happily accepted an invitation to join a mussel farming boat for a day. The boat was more like a tanker than a fishing boat and we headed out to the massive green-lipped mussel farms in the middle of the ocean. The crew hauled from the depths huge ropes thick with mussels. Large burlap sacks filled with mussels were transported from the boat’s deck back to shore by helicopter. On board, we slurped raw mussels from shells still dripping with seawater, and we steamed still more. From the ocean to the pot to our mouths. It doesn’t get much better.
2. shallot, finely sliced
3. bunch fresh thyme, plus more for garnishing
4. Put the grated horseradish, Worcestershire sauce, and heavy cream into a large bowl and set aside for 15 to 20 minutes to allow the horseradish to infuse the cream. Whisk until blended. Season to taste with salt and white pepper.
5. or fine-mesh sieve into another large bowl.
6. Pour the horseradish cream into the chilled canister of a foamer. The amount will fill it about halfway. Charge with 1 or 2 charges. Chill for at least 1 hour before serving.
7. Put the mussels in a saucepan with the white wine, shallot, and thyme sprigs. Cover and steam over high heat, shaking the pan occasionally, for 3 to 5 minutes or until the mussels have opened. Remove from the heat. Discard any unopened mussels. Remove the mussels from the liquid, transfer to a shallow bowl, cover, and chill thoroughly.
8. Remove the mussels from their shells, reserving the bottom shells for presentation. Discard the top shells.
9. To serve, fill the reserved bottom shells with potato salad and top with a mussel. Shake the foamer vigorously and place a little horseradish foam alongside each mussel. Garnish the mussel with a thyme sprig. Arrange each filled shell on a small plate. Alternatively, put coarse salt in a small bowl and add enough water to mix the salt to the texture of sand. Pile some “sand” on the plate and set the shell on top.
10. serves 6 to 10
11. Cut the potatoes into very small dice and put in a medium-sized saucepan. Add enough cold water to cover and then lightly salt the water. Bring to a boil over medium-high heat. Reduce the heat and simmer for about 5 minutes or until just tender. Drain and immediately submerge in cold water. Drain again.
12. Toss the potatoes, shallot, and chives in a bowl. Add the mayonnaise and mix gently until the vegetables are coated. Season to taste with salt, pepper, and cayenne.
