## Method

1. Cooking time25 minutes
2. Stick blenderStand mixer fitted
3. with the paddle beater
4. In a saucepan, bring ½ cup ( 125 ml) of the whipping cream to a boil with the vanilla
5. beans and seeds and the lavender flowers. Cover and allow to infuse for 30 minutes.
6. After infusion, reheat slightly and strain through a fine-mesh sieve onto the white
7. chocolate. Stir in the bloomed gelatin and blend with the stick blender to make a ganache. Add the remaining cream and then blend. Chill for about 6 hours before use.
8. Cream the butter with the cane sugar in the bowl of the stand mixer. Sift the almond flour and ground hazelnuts together, then add to the creamed butter and sugar and carefully mix. Add the salt and flour, and mix again gently until a dough is formed. Roll out the dough between 2 parchment sheets to a thickness of
9. plastic wrap and let rest in the refrigerator for about 2 hours. Line the tart mold with
10. the dough, checking that the corners and the bottom are perfectly perpendicular to each other and regular. Trim off the excess dough with a paring knife.
11. Cream the butter with the confectioners’ sugar in the bowl of the stand mixer. Add the almond flour and mix well at medium speed. Scrape down the sides and bottom of the bowl for even mixing. Add the vanilla extract and eggs a little at a time, continuing to beat the mixture. Scrape down the bowl again once the eggs are incorporated, and mix until smooth. Fill a pastry bag with the mixture and keep it at room temperature so that it is soft enough to pipe.
12. Neatly pipe enough almond cream into the tart shell to come halfway up the sides. Chill for about 1 hour. Preheat the oven to 350°F (180°C /Gas mark 4) and bake the
13. tart for about 25 minutes. Wash the apricots, remove the pits, and cut them into
14. cubes and quarters. Distribute the cubes evenly over the almond cream and arrange the quarters attractively on top. Whip the vanilla-lavender ganache until soft peaks form. Place in a pastry bag fitted with a plain tip and pipe dots of cream. Decorate with lavender flowers and micro-greens.Ingredients
