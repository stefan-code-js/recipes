## Method

1. could bounce off the metal and damage the magnetron (the oven’s generator). With newer machines, it is possible to heat foods in foil pans and to shield certain parts of the food by cov -
2. ering them with pieces of foil so they do not overheat. do not place two pieces of metal close
3. to one another, because sparks may be generated, causing a fire. f ollow the procedures recom-
4. mended by the manufacturer of the oven.
5. because microwaves cook so rapidly, they will not break down the connective tissues of less
6. tender meats. slow, moist cooking is necessary for dissolving these connective tissues.
7. The more food placed in a microwave at once, the longer the cooking time. Thus, the primary
8. advantage of microwave cooking-speed-is lost with large roasts and other large quantities.
9. COOKING SOUS VIDe
10. sous vide (soo veed) cooking. f rench for “under vacuum, ” the term is applied to cooking foods that
11. have been vacuum-sealed in plastic bags.
12. 1. Vacuum-pack the food item, plus any seasonings or marinades, in an appropriate plastic bag.
13. 2. cook the food item, while in the bag, at a constant low temperature, usually in a special water bath.
14. Precision Cooking
15. although the name of the technique refers to the vacuum packing, the heart of sous vide cooking-
16. and the reason many chefs are so excited about it-is the precise temperature control it permits.
17. as an example, think of roasting a boneless loin of lamb. on the one hand, we could place
18. the meat in an oven at 400°f (200°c ) and roast it until the center reaches a temperature of 140°f
19. (60°c ) for medium doneness. a s we discussed on , however, the lamb will be medium
20. done only in the center and more done everywhere else. i n addition, we would have to monitor the
21. cooking closely to make sure we remove it from the oven at the right time.
22. on the other hand, we could vacuum-pack the lamb loin in plastic and place it in a water bath
23. heated to an exact 140°f (60°c ). The temperature of the lamb would never go above that tempera-
24. ture, no matter how long we left it in the water bath. a nd it would be at exactly the same doneness
