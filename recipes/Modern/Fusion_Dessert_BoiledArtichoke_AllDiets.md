## Method

1. potassium metabisulphite to cook later. Remove these ideal leaves carefully -when you pull
2. them from the core, ensure that some of the choke remains at the tip of the leaf for guests to scrape off with their teeth.
3. Once the outer leaves have been removed, use a serrated knife to cut off the top 35% of the artichokes’ tops . From there, trim the artichokes’ bases with a sharp turning knife leaving 1 cm
4. of the stem at the base. Once the artichoke hearts are cleaned, submerge them in a solution o
5. otassium metabisulphite separate from the leaves. Vacuum seal the leaves with 1 00 mL of the
6. truffle juice and a bit of salt. In another bag, vacuum seal the hearts with the other 100 mL of truffle juice and a bit of salt as well. Cook both the leaves and hearts in a steam oven at 100°C (100% fan) until just tender to the touch. Begin checking the leaves for tenderness after 10 to 12

Garnish the artichoke heart piece with a piece of roasted kelpsalt on each and serve when guests are on the last bite of the “Celeriac Shawarma.” One plate ofboiled artichoke is to be shared between two guests.
