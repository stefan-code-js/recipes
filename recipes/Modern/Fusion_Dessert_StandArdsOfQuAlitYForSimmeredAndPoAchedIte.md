## Method

1. 1. foods should be cooked to the correct degree of doneness:
2. • poached tender poultry items and whole fish should be fully cooked but still moist and
3. tender, not overcooked or dry.
4. • poached meats should be cooked to the correct degree of doneness.
5. • tougher meat and poultry items should be cooked until fork-tender but still moist.
6. 2. flavoring ingredients in the poaching liquid should enhance the flavor of the main item, not
7. cover it up or conflict with it.
8. 3. after cooking, the item should be well drained. poaching liquid should not be transferred to the plate.
9. 4. poached items should be served hot, on hot plates.
10. 5. sauces should enhance the flavor of the item, not cover it up. most poached items have a fairly
11. delicate flavor, so in most cases they should not be served with strongly flavored sauces.

13. 1. Collect all equipment and food supplies.
14. 2. Prepare meat, poultry, or seafood for cooking. This may include
15. cutting, trimming, tying, or blanching.
16. 3. Prepare the cooking liquid:
17. • Review the discussion of cooking liquids above.
18. • For fresh meats and poultry, start with boiling, sea-soned liquid.
19. • For cured and smoked meats, start with cold, unsalted liquid to help draw out some of the salt from the meats.
20. • For seafood: Start shellfish, small fish, and portion cuts in hot liquid. Start large, whole fish in cold liquid to cook more evenly and to avoid sudden contractions that would split the skin and spoil the appearance.
21. • In all cases, use enough liquid to cover the food completely.
22. 4. Place the meat in the cooking liquid and return (or bring) to a simmer (Fig. 15.8).
23. 5. Reduce heat to maintain the proper simmering or poaching temperature. Do not allow the liquid to boil after the food has been added. Skim the surface, if necessary.
24. 6. Cook until the food is done, skimming as necessary.
25. • Simmered meat and poultry are cooked until the meat is tender, skimming as necessary. To test for doneness, insert a kitchen fork into the meat. The meat is tender if the fork slides out easily. This is called fork-tender.
26. • Poached tender poultry items should be fully cooked. Tender meats should be cooked to the desired degree of doneness. Both can be tested with an instant-read thermometer. Cooked poultry items should feel firm to the touch and the flesh should be opaque throughout.
27. • Fish should feel firm to the touch and the flesh should be opaque. Crustacean shells should have turned bright red or pink. Clams, oysters, and mussels should be open.
28. 7. If the food is to be served hot, remove from the liquid and serve immediately. If it is to be served cold or to be reheated later, cool it in its cooking liquid to retain moistness. Cool rapidly in a cold-water bath, as for stocks.
29. 8. Evaluate the finished product (see above).
