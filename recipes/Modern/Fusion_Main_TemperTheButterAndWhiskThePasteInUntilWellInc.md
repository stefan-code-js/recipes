## Method

1. COOKED IRISH MOSS
2. The moss can be very sandy. Wash the moss extremely thoroughly, changing the water often, using tweezers if necessary to ensure it is free of dirt. Fo r every 40 g of Irish moss, use 250 g of
3. the cucumber kelp broth and place both together in a sous vide bag, seal and then cook it at 90°C for approximately 30 minutes, until the moss is tender. Once cooked, remove it from the bag immediately. The Irish moss releases so much carrageenan that it will set the cooking liquidif it cools down even slightly. Make sure there is no gelled cooking liquid still attached to the
4. moss. If necessary, remove any tough main stems of the seaweed that may remain.
5. Wash the sea lettuce well in multiple changes of cold water. Portion the sea lettuce into

8. Just before service, place the kelp grass portions in a vacuum bag with enough yeast broth so that the seaweed is swimming. After it is compressed, it can be opened straight away and transferred to yogurt pots (still in the liquid) for service. Take a few strands of the seaweed, lay
9. them lengthwise, and form a roulade by rolling the seaweed over itself, 1 to 1.5 cm in diameter.Once rolled tight, cut 1 cm pucks off and reserve them as your portio ns.
