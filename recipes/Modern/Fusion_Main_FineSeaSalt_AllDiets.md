## Method

1. in the morning and decide you want to make bread in time for dinner that evening.
2. The Saturday Breads are designed for that schedule. But you want to try using more
3. water in the dough, say 78 percent hydration instead of 72 percent. So you use 780
4. grams of water instead of the 720 grams called for in the recipe. Because the dough
5. will be wetter and more slack, it needs an additional couple of folds to make up for
6. that. That will give the dough the structural support it needs, helping build up the
7. gluten network, which is relaxed by the extra water.
8. I do this all the time. If you want to work with a specific recipe but adjust the flour
9. available). The most important thing is to stick with the same total amount of flour
10. all white flour, but we can change it to a mix of 70 percent white flour, 20 percent
11. whole wheat flour, and 10 percent rye flour. (This will make a bread with a similar
12. grams, add 200 grams of whole wheat flour and 100 grams of light or dark rye flour
13. -and if you want, you can add a little more water, say 20 grams. But since the rye
14. same. The yeast and salt quantities also remain the same.
15. OVERNIGHT “WHITE” BREAD, NOW WITH WHITE, WHOLE WHEAT, RYE
16. BAKER’S PERCENTAGE
17. Whole wheat flour
