## Method

1. Cooking time
2. with the chopper blade
3. Stand mixer fitted
4. fresh lemon juice0.5 oz. ( 16 g) grated lime zest
5. ground almonds8 oz. ( 223 g) brown sugar
6. diced
7. softened3.5 oz. ( 100 g) brown sugar
8. 6.6 oz. ( 186 g) butter, diced
9. gelatin7.5 oz. ( 214 g) pistachio paste
10. Heat the butter and sugar and stir until smooth. Add the eggs, lemon juice, and
11. grated lime zest. Place back over the heat, whisking constantly, until the mixture comes to a simmer. Remove from the heat, add the bloomed gelatin, and blend. Fill the half-sphere molds and allow to set in the refrigerator.
12. Wash the lemons. Using a peeler, peel off the zest, removing as little as possible of the bitter white pith. Immerse the zests in a small saucepan half-filled with water and bring to a boil to blanch them. Drain and repeat the process twice more: this will ensure you retain the lemon flavor without any bitterness. Cook the zests with the lemon juice and sugar in a saucepan over medium heat for 40-50 minutes. When
13. well reduced, add the verbena leaves and blend, while still hot, in the food processor. Use sparingly, as this tangy mixture has an intense, concentrated flavor. Spoon a little into the center of each lemon cream.
14. Preheat the oven to 300°F (150°C /Gas mark 2). Combine all the dry ingredients
15. and rub in the butter until crumbly. Spread out thinly on a baking sheet lined with parchment paper and bake for 20 minutes.
16. Combine the ingredients to make a dough without incorporating any air. Roll out between 2 sheets of parchment paper to a thickness of
17. and then cut out disks the same size as the choux puffs and keep in the freezer until ready to use.
18. Increase the oven temperature to 400°F (210°C /Gas mark 6 ). Bring the milk, water,
19. butter, sugar, and salt to a boil in a saucepan. Remove from the heat, pour in all the sifted flour at once, and mix in using a spatula. Return to the heat and stir continuously for about 1 minute to dry out the mixture. Transfer to the stand mixer and whisk at medium speed to cool down the dough. When it stops steaming, beat in the egg, a little at a time, until fully incorporated and the dough is smooth. Spoon the dough into the pastry bag and pipe 6 rows of 4 choux puffs touching each other, and then
20. top each one with a craquelin disk. Bake for 20-25 minutes.
21. Bring the milk and cream to a boil in a saucepan. Beat the sugar and egg yolks in a bowl until pale and thick and add the sifted cornstarch. Whisk the hot milk into the yolk mixture and then continue to cook as for a pastry cream (see technique ). Stir
22. in the butter, gelatin, and pistachio paste and mix well.
23. Cut each row of choux horizontally into 2 layers. Spoon a little streusel into the bottom
24. of the puffs and then pipe a layer of pistachio cream. Place a half-sphere of lemon cream in the center of each puff, pipe the rest of the pistachio cream on top, and sprin -
25. kle with streusel. Carefully replace the choux lids and dust with confectioners’ sugar.
