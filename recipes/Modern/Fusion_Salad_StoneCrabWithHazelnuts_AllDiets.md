## Method

1. Blend all the picked meat with filtered water at a ratio of 1:1 in the Thermomix set to 60°C, speed 6, for 30 minutes. Once blended, transfer the mixture while still hot to a vacuum bag submerged in ice to cool it down rapidly. Seal the bag as much as possible, being careful not to
2. let the blended mixture explode out of the bag. After that, vacuum seal this bag in an additionalbag to ensure it doesn’t burst open when cooking. Once sealed, place the bag of crab purée intoa pot of boiling water and allow it to cook for 1 hour. The proteins will split out and clarify thebroth. When finished, strain the liquid through a fine -mesh nylon sieve and cool it down rapidly
3. Combine all the ingredients in a nonstick pan and place on an induction burner set to high.
4. When the pan comes to temperature and the contents begin to bubble, turn the heat down sothat the liquids bubble evenly. Reduce until the mixture becomes syrupy and reaches 66.6 ºBx -
5. we do not want the texture of a fudge or a caramel. Once reduced, transfer the reduction to ayogurt pot and reserve in the fridge until service.
6. This will be a daily job to ensure the freshness of the hazelnut milk.
7. Crack the hazelnuts and transfer them to a container of water to soak as you work. Soak the hazelnuts for 1 hour, then drain them and place them in a clean kitchen towel. Fold all sides ofthe towel up to create a sort of sack of soaked hazelnuts. Twist the top of the towel so that thesack of soaked hazelnuts is taut. Rub the hazelnuts wrapped in the towel -the friction will cause
8. the skins to loosen and peel off. Be aware that there is also a tiny thread on the hazelnuts tha
9. eeds to be removed.
