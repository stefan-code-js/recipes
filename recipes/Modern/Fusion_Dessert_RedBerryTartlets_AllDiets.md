## Method

1. Cooking time4
2. lb. 2 oz ( 500 g) raspberries
3. blended and strained4.5 oz. ( 125 g) raspberries,
4. blended and strained1.75 oz. ( 50 g) sugar
5. 6.5 oz. ( 190 g) confectioners’
6. sugar2 oz. ( 60 g) almond flour
7. 3.5 oz. ( 100 g) red currants MAKING THE RED BERRY JUICE
8. Place the strawberries, raspberries, and sugar in a heatproof mixing bowl. Cover with
9. plastic wrap and cook over a pan of hot water for 2 hours. Strain the juice through a
10. fine-mesh sieve into a bowl and set aside.
11. Preheat the oven to 480°F (250°C /Gas mark 9) and put a baking sheet in the oven.
12. Soak the gelatin in ice-cold water for 10 minutes. In a saucepan, heat the water and
13. blended berries. Mix the sugar and pectin together and add to the mixture. Bring to a boil, stirring constantly, then simmer for 3 minutes. Remove from the heat, add the squeezed gelatin, and stir in until dissolved. Remove the hot baking sheet from the oven and coat it evenly with a thin layer of the fruit mixture. Reduce the heat to 190°F (90°C ), or use an étuve (drying oven) and, dry out the fruit mixture for 2 hours.
14. Remove from the oven and immediately cut out and peel off the desired shapes.
15. Combine the sifted dry ingredients in a bowl and lightly rub in the butter to a sandy texture. Incorporate the beaten eggs. When the dough is smooth, cover in plastic wrap and chill for 20 minutes. Roll out the dough and line the oblong molds. Preheat the
16. oven to 300°F (155°C /Gas mark 2). Chill for 20 minutes, then blind bake for 7 minutes.
17. Increase the oven temperature to 350°F (180°C /Gas mark 4). Using an electric hand
18. beater, whisk the whites to the soft peak stage and beat in the sugar to stiffen them. Sift in the confectioners’ sugar and the ground toasted hazelnuts and carefully fold into the meringue using a spatula. Spread onto a parchment-lined baking sheet and bake for 5 minutes. Turn out onto a wire rack. Cut out oval shapes the same size as the pastry shells. Moisten the sponges with the red berry juice.
19. Place the milk and vanilla bean and seeds in a saucepan and bring to a boil. In a bowl, beat the egg yolks with the sugar and custard powder until pale and thick. Stir a little of the hot milk into the egg mixture until you have a smooth liquid, then pour it back into the saucepan. Bring to a boil, whisking vigorously. Take the pan off the heat and gradually incorporate the butter. Cool quickly, then strain through a fine-mesh sieve.
20. Using the hand beater, beat the whipping cream until it forms soft peaks. Combine the pastry cream with the heavy cream and carefully fold in the whipped cream.
21. Soak the gelatin in ice-cold water for 10 minutes. In a saucepan, heat the red berry
22. juice, add the squeezed gelatin, and stir until dissolved. Pour into a lightly greased mold. Allow the jelly to set for 1 hour in the refrigerator, then cut it into small cubes.
23. Finely dice some of the berries and sprinkle over the hazelnut sponges. Pipe a layer of heavy cream mousse over the fruit and place an upside-down tart shell on top. Decorate the center with cream, fruit, jelly cubes, and berry parchment shapes.
