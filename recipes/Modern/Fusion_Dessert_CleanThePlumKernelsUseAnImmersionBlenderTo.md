## Method

1. Cook the sugar and water until it reaches 121°C on a candy thermometer. When the sugar andwater reaches 116°C, begin to whip the egg whites. When the egg whites begin to foam and froth, add an additional teaspoon of sugar to ensure stability in the meringue. When the sugarreaches 121°C, remove it from the heat, and slowly pour into the egg whites while they are whipping on full speed. After all the sugar has been added, continue to whip on full speed until
2. the meringue cools down to 30°C.
3. Temper the yogurt. Bloom the gelatin in ice water. Whip 80 g of the plum kernel cream to softpeaks and reserve on the side. Heat the remaining 40 g plum kernel cream and dissolve the
4. gelatin into the cream. Once dissolved, pour this into the tempered yogurt (it should not be
5. fridge cold). Once you have combined the two, strain this through a conical strainer to ensure that there are no pieces of gelatin remaining. Once strained, begin to fold in the Swiss meringueby thirds. When the meringue is fully incorporated, fold in the whipped plum kernel cream by thirds. Once fully incorporated, set the mousse in a 1 L container that has been sprayed with
6. it of fat spray, and transfer to the freezer to set. The mousse should be 1 to 1.5 cm thick. Once
7. set, remove the mousse from its 1 L container, and cut it into rectangles that are 7.5 cm long and 4.5 cm tall. Reserve these rectangles of mousse in the freezer until service.
