## Method

1. Preheat the oven to 325°F and position a rack in the center of the oven. Have ready six to eight 1-inch-diameter tartlet pans and a baking sheet.
2. In a small bowl, whisk the crème fraîche and egg yolk until blended. Set aside.
3. Put the flour and salt in the bowl of an electric mixer fitted with the paddle attachment and mix at low speed until combined. Add the butter and mix until the mixture is the consistency of sand. Add the crème fraîche mixture and continue to mix until the liquid is absorbed and the dough is starting to come together. Do not overmix.
4. Turn the dough out onto a lightly floured work surface. Shape into a disk. Wrap in plastic wrap and refrigerate for at least 1 hour or until firm enough to roll out.
5. Lightly dust the work surface and a rolling pin with flour. Roll out the dough into a very thin sheet, about ¼ inch thick, dusting the work surface and dough with additional flour as needed. Cut out rounds of dough with a biscuit cutter slightly larger than the diameter of the tartlet pans. Center each round in the bottom of a tartlet pan and press the dough onto the bottom and up the sides of the pan without stretching. Place the tartlet shells on a baking sheet and refrigerate for at least 1 hour before baking.
6. Bake in the middle of the oven for 8 to 10 minutes or until light brown. Transfer the baking sheet with the shells to a wire rack to cool completely.
