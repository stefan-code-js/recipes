## Method

### Preparation

1. I don’t deny that this recipe is more complicated than most others in the book, but for foie gras, it’s pretty easy. All you need is time and plenty of kosher or coarse salt. The foie gras is not cooked but instead buried in salt and left to cure for nine to ten hours. The result is sublime!
2. Foie gras is the fattened liver of geese or ducks that have been raised on a rich diet and force-fed grain (usually corn) during the last five or six weeks before butchering. Although goose foie gras is richer than duck foie gras, both work well here. To earn the grade A label, a liver must weigh at least a pound-most weigh a little more-and be as free of bruising as possible. Look for those that are smooth and pale, with few veins. When cooked or cured, the foie gras will be silken, rich, and indescribably sumptuous.
3. When I was in Monaco, I tasted foie gras prepared by the world-famous chef Alain Ducasse, who served it with pineapple. Here, I serve it with a peppery relish in which the sweetness of the fruit commingles with the pepper and cuts through the foie gras’s fat. I love this served on buttery brioche garnished with slightly sour currants. These can be assembled days ahead of time, which is why I often serve them at large parties. They hold up so well, I encourage you to make them as an hors d’oeuvre.
4. or from a good bakery
5. Fresh currants, for garnishing
6. Gently pull the two lobes of the foie gras apart to remove all veins, blood clots, and sinews.
7. In a small bowl, mix together the 2 teaspoons salt, the pepper, the sugar, and the
8. teaspoon pink salt. Coat the foie gras with the salt mixture. Sprinkle with the Grand Marnier and then tightly cover the bowl with plastic wrap. Refrigerate for 1 hour.
9. Dampen a 3-foot square of cheesecloth and spread it out on a clean work surface. Place the liver at one end and roll up into a cylinder. Twist the overhanging ends in opposite directions to secure the liver tightly (forming a
10. ). Tie the ends with kitchen string. Put the foie gras
11. in a clean shallow pan and refrigerate for 45 minutes.
12. Cover the bottom of a small pan, such as an 8-inch “brownie pan,” with a generous layer of kosher salt. Add the
13. and cover with more kosher salt, making sure the liver is completely buried in the salt. Refrigerate for 9 to 10 hours.
14. Remove the
15. from the salt and unwrap the cheesecloth. Wrap the foie gras in plastic wrap, set on a plate, and refrigerate for up to 2 days.
16. To serve, use a hot knife to cut the foie gras into ¼-inch-thick slices. Place each slice on a small plate along with some of the pineapple relish, a slice of brioche, and a few currants for garnish.
17. Peel, core, and remove the brown “eyes” from the pineapple. Cut the flesh into very fine dice. Put the diced pineapple in a fine-mesh sieve set over a small bowl and allow the juice to drain from the pineapple. You should have about 2 cups of juice. Reserve the juice and flesh separately.
18. Spread the pepper in a dry frying pan and toast over medium-high heat, shaking the pan frequently, for 40 to 50 seconds or until fragrant. Transfer to a plate and allow to cool completely.

### Cooking

19. Put the pineapple juice in a small saucepan and cook over medium heat until reduced by half. Add the brown sugar and stir until dissolved. Allow to cool.
20. Pour the pineapple juice over the reserved diced pineapple and toss. Add the pepper and mix well.
