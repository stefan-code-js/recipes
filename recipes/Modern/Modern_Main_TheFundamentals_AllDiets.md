## Method

1. Every dish we create, every plate we serve-must adhere to these four fundamentals. On the surface, they may seem simple, but they are anything but. It’s important to note that in their application, these concepts can clash, but it is our task to find balance between them.
2. This is our guide every day in the kitchen. It may sound strange, but defining a set of rules has actually given us freedom. Sometimes, it feels as if we’ve learned a new language, a new vehicle of expression.
3. It’s as if we stand at the beginning of our journey again.
4. Our food must be delicious. This needs to be an immediate and visceral response. Either it is or it is not delicious. There is no gray area here. I hold myself to showcasing our ingredients as pure expressions of themselves-serving them with the intention that they taste like what they are. I want carrots to taste like carrots; I want beef to taste like beef-the most pristine and perfect example I can present.
5. Aesthetics are impactful, holding great weight. When you look upon a dish, it must be beautiful. For me, the allure is in the natural, the organic, and the minimal-and it must appear almost effortless. The plate as a whole must be considered-but the elements themselves must guide our eye and our hand.
6. We must push ourselves to be creative and to challenge our ideas and beliefs. Only then can we truly discover and create fresh and exciting things. Exploring new techniques, flavors, ingredients; finding elements of surprise and intrigue-this is essential. Without creativity, our food will not evolve.
7. A dish needs to have a story. A dish’s existence needs to make sense-whether that means we are drawing from the past, the present, the future, or another narrative. Inspiration can come from the season or the farmer and the land; a memory of childhood or a lesson from a mentor in the past; the work of artists in other mediums. An intentional dish is one with soul.
