## Method

### Preparation

1. When I was in Spain a few years ago, I was dazzled by the pure white marble tables set up in the Barcelona food markets to sell fresh and dried cod. The fresh fish was displayed in big water-filled tubs and the dried was packed in salt. I was equally impressed by the endless and creative ways Spanish cooks prepared salt cod, which we in America tend to dismiss as not very interesting. We’re wrong. Dried cod has to be soaked for twenty-four hours in cold water and then milk to keep it white and creamy, but once it’s hydrated, it’s delicious. Here, I make it into a creamy brandade that is spooned onto crostini smeared with a simple olive and caper paste. The contrast of the creamy cod brandade and the bold-flavored olive paste makes a powerful amuse. This dish was inspired by the cooking of Martin Berasategie, who is the chef-owner of the three-star Michelin restaurant of the same name in Lasarte, Spain-and who also has his own line of china. Look for it; you’ll love it!
2. cup chopped flat-leaf parsley
3. clove garlic, chopped
4. to 10 slices baguette
5. Put the cod in a large ceramic or glass bowl and cover with cold water. (It may be necessary to slice the fish into sections to fit in the bowl.) Refrigerate for 24 hours, pouring off and replacing the water twice during soaking. During the final 8 hours, soak the fish in milk to cover. This keeps the fish white and gives it a clean, creamy flavor.
6. Remove the cod from the refrigerator and pour off the milk. Pull off and discard any skin and bones from the cod. Cut the flesh into 2-inch pieces.

### Cooking

7. Heat ¼ cup of the olive oil in a large sauté pan over low heat. When the oil is hot, add the cod. Cook for about 3 minutes on each side or until the cod is cooked through and the thickest part of the fish flakes easily.
8. Remove the pan from the heat and transfer the cod to a saucepan. Set the pan over medium heat and gradually pour in the cream and the remaining ¼ cup olive oil, working the mixture quickly and vigorously with a wooden spoon until the fish is reduced to a coarse puree and most of the liquid is absorbed. Season to taste with salt and pepper. Allow to cool, cover, and refrigerate.
9. is cold, mix in the parsley.
10. Combine the olives, capers, and garlic in a blender and puree to a smooth paste. Transfer to a small bowl.
11. To serve, spread a thin layer of the olive paste over a slice of baguette. Top with a dollop of cod
12. and place on a small plate. Repeat to make 5 to 9 more servings.
