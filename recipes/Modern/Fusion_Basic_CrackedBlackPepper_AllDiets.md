## Method

1. For this pizza, the trick is to lightly cook the bacon, rendering some of its fat while
2. leaving it uncooked enough that it will crisp but not burn in the oven while the pizza
3. is baking. Cook the bacon until about halfway to crisp, then let it drain on paper
4. towels before putting it on the pizza. Scatter all of the toppings evenly over the
5. dough and bake for 15 to 20 minutes, until the bacon cooks to a crisp on the pizza
6. and the tomatoes crack and burst under the high heat, oozing their juices into the
7. clove garlic, chopped
8. after it comes out of the oven. It tastes like summer. Toss the squash with the olive
9. evenly over the dough. Season with black pepper and additional salt, along with
10. some chile flakes. Bake for 15 to 20 minutes, until the dough is cooked through.
