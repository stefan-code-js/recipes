## Method

1. I was blessed to work a stage at the legendary chef Alain Chapel’s restaurant in France during the eighties and I will never forget him. Needless to say, the chef’s influence on how I think about food and how I cook was significant. His overall brilliance had great impact on the culinary community and is still greatly missed. He made a dish similar to this one with smoked sturgeon, and so, in appreciation of what he taught me, I devised this pretty, yet simple, amuse. Layer the crepes and salmon as many times as you can-sandwiching them with cream cheese or crème fraîche-and then cut them into tiny wedges.
2. This resembles a savory napoleon, and I serve it with a simple garnish of celery leaves dressed with lemon and olive oil. Crepes are endlessly versatile and can be served with savory fillings, as here, or with sweet ones. They are somewhat out of style these days, and while they are destined to make a comeback (and it won’t be their first), they are always welcome at Tru. Cook them in a crepe pan and make sure the flame is medium. If it’s too high, the batter will toughen before it cooks, and the crepes will brown more than you want for this recipe.
3. ½ pound thinly sliced smoked salmon
4. cucumber flowers, for garnishing
5. Put the cream cheese in a small bowl with 2 teaspoons of the lemon juice. Mix well and season to taste with salt and pepper.
6. Using a 3-inch round cookie cutter, stamp out 4 rounds of smoked salmon and 5 rounds of crepes.
7. Place 1 crepe on a work surface and top with a salmon round. Spread about 1 tablespoon of the cream cheese over the salmon. Continue the layering, so that you end with a plain crepe on top of the stack.
8. Put the celery leaves in a small bowl and toss with the olive oil, lemon zest, chives, and remaining 1 teaspoon lemon juice. Season to taste with salt and pepper.
9. To serve, divide the celery salad among 6 small plates. Cut the stack of salmon crepes into 6 wedges. Arrange a wedge and a cucumber flower on each plate.
10. Whisk together the flour, sugar, and salt in a medium-sized bowl. Make a well in the center and pour in the milk. Whisk the milk into the flour mixture until the batter is smooth and well blended. Whisk in the eggs until blended.
11. Strain the batter through a sieve into another medium-sized bowl. Cover with plastic wrap and refrigerate for at least 2 hours to give the batter time to rest.
12. Heat an 8-inch nonstick skillet or crepe pan over medium heat. Lightly brush the pan with melted butter.
13. Ladle about ¼ cup of the batter into the skillet and tilt the pan in all directions to evenly coat the bottom. Cook the crepe for about 30 seconds or until the bottom is light brown. Loosen the edges with a spatula and flip the crepe over with the spatula or your fingers. Cook the underside for 10 to 15 seconds or until it is set, dry, and browned in spots. Slide the crepe onto a flat plate and cover with a piece of wax paper.
14. Repeat with the remaining batter, brushing the pan with more butter as needed, and stacking the crepes between wax paper. The crepes may be made up to 3 days ahead. Cover with plastic wrap and refrigerate. Bring to room temperature before using.
