9. 1. Cut the bones into pieces, 3-4 inches (8-10 cm) long,
10. as for white stock. Veal and/or beef bones are used for brown stock.
11. 2. Do not wash or blanch the bones. The moisture would hinder browning.
12. 3. Place the bones in a roasting pan in one layer and brown in a hot oven at 375°F (190°C) or higher (Fig. 8.5a). The bones must be well browned to color the stock sufficiently. This takes over 1 hour. Some chefs prefer to oil the bones lightly before browning.
13. 4. When the bones are well browned, remove them from the pan and place them in a stockpot. Cover with cold water and bring to a simmer.
14. 5. Drain and reserve the fat from the roasting pan. Deglaze the pan by adding water and stirring over heat until all the brown drippings are dissolved or loosened. Add to the stockpot.
15. 6. While the stock is getting started, place the mirepoix in the roasting pan with some of the reserved fat and brown the vegetables well in the oven.
16. 7. Add the tomato product to the mirepoix. Continue to brown until the tomato product turns a rusty brown color. (See alternative procedure below.)
17. 8. When the water in the stockpot comes to a simmer, skim and continue as for white stock.

### Cooking

18. 9. Add the browned vegetables and the tomato product to the stockpot. If desired, they may be held out until 2-3 hours before the end of the cooking time.
19. 10. Continue as for white stock.
20. The mirepoix may be browned with the bones. When the bones are half browned, add the mirepoix to the pan and continue roast-ing until bones and vegetables are browned.
