## Method

1. Combine both ingredients in a pressure cooker. Secure the lid of the pressure cooker and
2. transfer it to the stove. Set the induction burner to setting 5 and wait for steam to release from
3. the pressure cooker. Once it begins to steam, turn the induction burner down to setting 2 andcook them together for 30 minutes, starting the timer from the moment the pressure cooker begins releasing steam. Once cooked, let the pressure cooker rest for 15 minutes before releasing the pressure and removing the lid. (Alternatively, you can transfer the pressure cooke
