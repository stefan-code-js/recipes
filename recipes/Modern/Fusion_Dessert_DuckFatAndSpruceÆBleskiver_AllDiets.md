## Method

1. Begin by placing the butter in a small saucepot to melt over low heat on the stove. Using a stand
2. mixer with the whisk attachment, add the flour and salt to the mixer bowl, turn the machine on,
3. and begin incorporating the two ingredients. Weigh out the cre am and egg yolks together and
4. slowly add them into the already working mixer. The fatty liquids will cause the batter to clump
5. up and it will become difficult to work. Stop the machine and push any batter stuck in the whiskattachment back into the bowl. Turn the machine back on and slowly mix the ingredients together until they are a bit more homogeneous, about 2 minutes. Slowly add the melted butter. This will cause the mixture to loosen up and become much easier to mix. Continue mixing on a medium to hig h speed to further incorporate the ingredients and add the remainin
6. utter. Be careful not to overwork the gluten in the batter -if it appears slightly lumpy, this is
7. okay. Remove the batter and reserve in a separate bowl.
8. Clean the mixer bowl and whisk and dry them both very well. We will whisk the egg whites next,and do not want any water getting into the meringue. Add the egg whites to the mixer bowl andbegin to whisk on high speed. Once foaming, start to add the granulated sugar bit by bit. Oncethe sugar is fully incorporated, let the whites whisk till stiff peaks are formed. When they are,
9. turn off the machine and begin to incorporate the meringue into our first batter -slowly at first.
10. Continue until fully incorporated. Once the batter has been lea vened by the meringue properly,
11. transfer it to piping bags and allow it to rest in the fridge for at least 30 minutes before cooking.
12. Scoop the fat into spoonful -size scoops and place the fat in an appropriate ly sized container,
13. filling it about three -quarters full. Using the cold smoker speed rack, fill the smoking coil with
14. smoking dust. Add a few pieces of lit charcoal to the coil to ignite the smoking dust and transfe
15. t to the bottom rung of the cold smok er speed rack. Place the containers of duck fat in
16. perforated gastro trays or resting racks, in the top shelves of the cold smoker speed rack. Zip thecover of the cold smoker closed and allow the duck fat to smoke for a minimum of 45 minutes.
17. Be sure to c heck that the smoking coil is properly lit and continuously producing smoke. Check
18. the duck fat after 45 minutes to make sure that it has been heavily saturated in smoke. Reservethe smoked duck fat in the fridge.
