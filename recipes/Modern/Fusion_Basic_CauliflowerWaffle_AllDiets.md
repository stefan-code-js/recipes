## Method

1. BUCKWHEAT TOSTADA
2. g buckwheat flour
3. g Roasted Kelp Powder*
4. This recipe should produce 25 to 30 tostadas.
5. In a mixing bowl, sift and mix all the dry ingredients. In a separate mixing bowl, mix all the wet
6. ingredients except the brown butter with a whisk until homogeneous. Whisk the dry ingredientsinto the wet in gredients and mix well. Once well mixed, fold in the melted brown butter.
7. Transfer this finished batter to piping bags and refrigerate to rest for a minimum of 4 hours.
8. Once the batter has rested, set up an electric waffle iron, and heat it to setting 6. Across the
9. center of the hot iron, pipe 2 small circles of batter, each about the size of a bottle cap. Close the iron and apply pressure for about 5 seconds. Open the iron, pipe 2 circles again, and close
10. the iron for 10 more seconds. Open the iron and (using a squeeze bottle) drizzle some
11. grapeseed oil onto the cooking tostada. Close the lid and cook for another 2 minutes. Once cooked, remove the waffle from the iron and punch out 2 portions using a 7.5 cm ring mold. Ifthe tostadas are not properly caramelized, then can be placed in the iron for a few extra seconds to achieve the desired golden brown color. Once properly colored and cooked, transferthe finished buckwheat tostadas to a dry airtight container and reserve until service.
12. Combine all the ingredients together thoroughly without aerating the mixture. Reserve in pipingbags.
13. g shallot, finely chopped
