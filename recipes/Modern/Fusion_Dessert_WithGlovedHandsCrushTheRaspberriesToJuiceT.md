## Method

1. With gloved hands, crush the raspberries to juice them. We do not want to use the Thermomix,
2. immersion blender, or mortar and pestle for this job because we want to avoid breaking the seeds in the raspberries. Simply massage the fruit to juice it. Pass this raspberry pulp through a coarse sieve to remove the seeds and then pass the remaining juice through a superbag or fine -
3. mesh nylon sieve. Season the passed juice with 10% of its weight in honey, depending on the sweetness of the raspberry juice (which will change throughout the course of the summer). Reserve the juice in the fridge.
4. Set up a Styrofoam ice cream container half filled with liquid nitrogen. Place the pie molds in the
5. liquid nitrogen for 40 seconds. Using a pair of long, skinny tongs, remove a frozen mold from thenitrogen and carefully dip the bottom of it into the rhubarb pie shell. As you dip, you want to almost roll the bottom of the mold through the base to prevent an air bubble from forming in the pie. The depth of the dip should be 0.5 cm up the edge of the frozen mold. Once dipped, invert the mold on the table to allow the pie shell to set. After approximately 30 seconds, you should be able to d elicately remove the dipped pie shell without using any force. If force is
6. necessary, let the shell sit for 10 to 20 more seconds, until it can be removed easily. Once removed, transfer the pie shell to a container, and freeze in the blast chiller.
7. The process for making these pie shells is the same for both shells and for the cream. Repeat th
8. per portion (one of which will be coated in a berry powder mix). Reserve the pie shells in
9. separate containers in the freezer.
10. Peel the apples and reserve the skins. Core the peeled apples and discard the cores. Vacuum seal the apple flesh and apple skin separately. Set a circulator and water bath to 90°C. Cook th
11. pple flesh in the water bath for 30 minutes and the apple skin for 1 hour. Shock immediately
12. after their respective timers go off. Once cooled, blend the cooked apple flesh and apple skins together in the Thermomix into a s mooth purée. Once blended, pass the purée through a
13. conical strainer and reserve in the fridge.
