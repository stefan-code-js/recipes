## Method

1. You’ll need a 12-quart round tub with a lid for mixing your dough by hand and to hold
2. the dough as it rises. I recommend Cambro brand translucent polycarbonate
3. model number is RFSCW12. These tubs are available online from Amazon and at most
4. restaurant supply stores that sell to the public.
5. If you choose another brand, that’s fine; just be sure it’s a food-grade container. What
6. is important is the size; it needs to be big enough to allow you to mix and fold the dough
7. by hand within the container and to contain the dough as it expands. The round shape
8. trap ingredients. A clear container is best because you can see through it to chart the
9. progress of the rise. And of course you need a lid to keep the dough from drying out
10. weighing, mixing, and folding the dough. There isn’t any need to dump the dough onto
11. top until the final stage, when you divide and shape the loaves. Using the
12. tub streamlines the process and makes it easy. I’ve found that these 12-quart tubs have
13. other uses too. I use mine for brining chicken or turkey, or sometimes as an ice bucket for
14. (round, about 10 inches in diameter, and about 8 inches deep, with a lid), give it a try.
15. Although smaller tubs are available, it’s difficult to mix the dough by hand in them, and
16. impossible to fold the dough without removing it from the tub first.
17. and for making poolish or biga. Again, I recommend the clear Cambro tubs, which are
18. available wherever the 12-quart tubs are sold. You will only need two of these if you
19. plan to make a poolish or biga while you already have a levain culture going. In testing
20. recipes for this book I only ever needed one at a time.
21. All of the breads in this book are baked in a 4-quart Dutch oven with a lid. Baking the
22. bread in a preheated Dutch oven allows you to make fantastic bread at home that looks
23. like it came from a great bakery. While most Dutch ovens are heatproof to 500°F
