## Method

1. Except for the ramson capers, place all the ingredients together in a pot and bring the mixture
2. up to a simmer. Whisk the mixture until loosely emulsified and then add the ramson capers.
3. Reserve warm for service.
4. During service, preheat a small sauté pan. Add a spoon of the smoked butter. Lightly season the
5. portion of tongue with salt and drop it into the pan. Top it with a small piece of aluminum foil and depress it with a saucepot lid to prevent it from curling. Once seared on one side, remove the foil, and turn the tongue over. Add the lemon thyme and continue cooking the tongue, basting it with the foaming smoked butter. Once cook ed just under medium, remove the tongue
6. from the pan and allow it to rest and carry through. Once lightly rested, trim the edges to ensureit is one bite. Season with a little bit of salt, the coriander and gooseberry paste, and freshly
7. cracked black pepper. Finish by drizzling a spoonful of the reindeer tongue spice butter over the
8. top and spear it with a small pine skewer.
9. Combine all the ingredients and reserve.
10. 0.5 g ground freeze -dried rhubarb
11. Smash the juniper berry with a mortar and pestle until finely ground. Then add the elderberry vinegar and chicken wing garum, and muddle everything together. Pass the mixture through a fine-mesh nylon sieve. Proceed to mix in the cep oil and freeze-dried rhubarb powder. Reserve.
