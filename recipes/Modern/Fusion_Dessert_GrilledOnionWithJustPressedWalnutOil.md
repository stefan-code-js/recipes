## Method

1. The onions should be slightly smaller than a tennis ball with the tops on. Oil the onions with grapeseed oil and place them directly into white -hot coals in a barbecue. Cook them directly on
2. the coals until completely blackened on the outside. Remove them and transfer them to a rack
3. above th e barbecue and keep cooking them while turning them until tender on the inside. This
4. should take approximately 15 minutes. Use a cake tester to test how easy it is to pierce the
5. center of the onions. Do not overcook them, as the cooking process will carry over once they are
6. removed from the heat. Once cooked, make an incision through the first 2 or 3 layers. Using sharp scissors, cut the top and the bottom of the heart to remove it and transfer it to a container to keep it warm. Reserve the vessel warm as well.
7. Chopped chives
8. Season the walnut oil with a bit of salt and set it to the side. Slice the onion heart laterally into 3pieces, brush each piece with red pepper tamari, and season in between each slice with chopped chives and smoked salt. Reassemble the onion heart into a whole and place the onion
9. back into the corresponding grilled onion vessel. Add 1 spoonful of seasoned walnut oil to the
10. cut onion heart inside the onion vessel. Close the vessel, plate, and serve immediately.
