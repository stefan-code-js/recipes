## Method

1. Set a pan on an induction cooktop, preheat on setting 5, add the oil, and sear the straw berries
2. facedown until well caramelized and almost burnt. Flip the berries and continue to cook until
3. the other side has caramelized as much as the first. Once equally caramelized, use a rubber spatula to remove the sautéed strawberries from the pan. Pass the mixture through a fine tamislined with a fine -mesh nylon sieve and allow it to cool. Transfer the passed paste to piping bags
4. for service. Reserve in the fridge.
5. The magnolia blossoms will be brined ahead of time by the fermentation lab. The anatomy of the blossom is similar to that of an endive. Peel back the individual leaves and separate the ones
6. that look best for service. Do not cut the bottom of the leaves because they have the best
7. texture. Store the prepped blossoms in a bit of the leftover brine until service. Be careful whenprepping these magnolias as we have a very limited quantity -you should get approximately 3
8. portions’ worth of magnolia petals per blossom. In the center of the b lossom is the undeveloped
9. pistil of the magnolia flower. The pistil is composed of many smaller pistils . You will need to pick
10. or 4 of these smaller pistils to put on the tip of each white asparagus stalk. Also store these pistils in some of the brine until service.
11. As you are prepping these blossoms, do not waste anything-flowers or brine. Return any scrapsback to the brine, and store for future use.
