## Method

1. When I made cold cucumber soup one summer, I juiced some extra cucumbers to punch up the soup’s flavor. As I worked, I drank nearly as much of the juice as I stirred into the soup, which led me to believe my customers would like it too. I experimented to find an herb that would best complement the cucumbers, and while both sage and basil were good, the mints tasted best. I suggest you experiment on your own with the fresh mints and basils available nowadays. Serve this icy cold-it will quench any thirst!
2. Put the water and pineapple mint in a medium-sized saucepan and bring to a simmer over medium-high heat. Reduce the heat and simmer very gently for 5 minutes. Remove from the heat and set aside to steep until the water comes to room temperature.
3. or fine-mesh sieve into a bowl.
4. or fine-mesh sieve into a large pitcher. Stir in the infused water. Add the lemon juice and enough of the syrup to balance any bitterness. Season to taste with salt and pepper. Cover and refrigerate for 2 hours or until chilled.
5. Stir before pouring into small, chilled glasses for serving.
