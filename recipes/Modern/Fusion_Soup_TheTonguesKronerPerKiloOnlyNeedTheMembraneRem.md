## Ingredients

- is little loss. Tongues and cheeks are sold in 10kg pails in a 20 per cent salt
- brine. He uses phosphate in the salt! Almost all his fish are sold to Spain.
- himself as Eirikur a Husam0rk. The factory only dries fish heads (30 kroner
- per kilo), and lots of them. Mainly cod but also other fish varieties. Oddly
- work in basalt. We make arrangements for him to try to drill an indentation
- Marinated raw whale, puffin, angler fish, cod jaw, whale steak with fried
- onions, fulmar, rhubarb. I guess the meal could be described as 'interesting~

## Method

1. quick stop at the baker's to get drilur ( a type of dark rye bread) ... Tastes great,
2. will be used at the restaurant in one way or another.
3. Trondur's house is a fantastic place. Everything is built in driftwood
4. and stone. Located 30 metres up on a hill as close to the water as you can get.
5. The silence is deep, the air is clean and the presence of nature is overwhelming.
6. for the restaurant's name. We see his family farm and feel 'the Viking spirit'
7. in the 900-year-old dining hall. Trondur explains that everything in the
8. dining room is original. It's difficult to believe that you can find something
9. so old and authentic in the West, and that it's still inhabited. It's almost like
10. standing in the middle of a film set. This I will never forget! We meet his
11. quality. The animals live on the wild grasses that grow on his land -all
12. completely natural! May be able to buy lamb from him in the right season.
13. On the way back to T6rshavn, we make a stop at Eydun's. He shows us his
14. work in basalt. We make arrangements for him to try to drill an indentation
15. on a small fragment. Perhaps to be used in the restaurant as a plate. Stone
16. should be a significant material in the restaurant. Trondur drives us to the
17. Hotel Hafnia, where we eat an eight-course menu with Faroese specialities.
18. onions, fulmar, rhubarb. I guess the meal could be described as 'interesting~
