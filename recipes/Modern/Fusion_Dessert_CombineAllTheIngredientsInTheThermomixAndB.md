## Method

1. Combine all the ingredients in the Thermomix and blend on speed 5.5 with the machine set to
2. 85°C. Once the Thermomix reaches 85°C, turn off the machine and transfer the contents to a container -do not pass this liquid. Reserve this rhubarb crisp base in the fridge to rest
3. The following day, remove the rhubarb crisp base from the fridge, return it to the Thermomix,and blend it again till it reaches the consistency of a fluid gel. Transfer some of this gel to pipingbags, which we will use in the assembly process.
4. Set up flat trays lined with Silpats. Line the Silpats using narrow pieces cut from additional Silpats (2 pieces high) to give yourself a guide. Spread the remaining rhubarb crisp base in between these guides on the Silpat -lined trays. Leave the gel to dry in an oven at 65°C
5. The following day, set up the oven to 200°C, and put a few flat trays inside, upside down. Carefully remove the hot trays from the oven and place your dried rhubarb crisp sheet on the tray to heat it, rendering the sheet malleable. Once softened due to the heat of the tray, slid
6. he sheet onto a separate Silpat and use a 6 cm ring cutter to punch out rhubarb crisp circles. As
7. the warm rhubarb crisp sheet cools down, it will harden again. Take another hot tray from theoven to warm it and thereby making it flexible again to punch out more rhubarb crisp circles. Continue cycling hot trays in and out of the oven to maximize the amount of rhubarb crisp circles you can yield from the sheets of dried rhubarb. Reserve these discs in an airtight container.
8. Once your discs are punched out, continue to rotate hot trays in and out of the oven, and warmthe discs on them until malleable. Once flexible, press the warm discs in between two pie moldsto shape them into a pie shell. They should be cool enough to pick up after approximately 30 seconds of pressing. Once you can remove the pie shell, transfer to an airtight container until service. Do not store in a dehydrator. If the pie shells are heated again, they will become flexible
9. Blend all the ingredients together in a spice grinder and reserve in an airtight container.
