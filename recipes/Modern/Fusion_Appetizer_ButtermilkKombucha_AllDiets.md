## Method

1. a whisk to mix. Once combined, use an immersion blender to blend in the milk powder, the salt,
2. and the Procrema. Allow the mixture to cool before blending in the buttermilk (fat solids will
3. curdle in buttermilk at a temperature above 65°C). Once the buttermilk is incorporated, allowthe mixture to rest for 1 hour. After resting, blend the ice cream base once more to fully incorporate and activate the Procrema. Transfer the base to Pacojet containers and freeze.
4. Once frozen, cycle the ice cream through the Pacojet. When spun, transfer the ice cream to a
5. piping bag, and fill the cherry molds with the ice cream. Use an offset spatula to smooth the topof the molds and place in a blast chiller to set. Once set, pop out t he ice cream “cherries” and
6. store them in parchment square -lined 1 L containers in the freezer until service.
7. In an appropriately sized container, combine the Himalayan green tea and the filtered water. Allow these two ingredients to cold -infuse for a minimum of 12 to 14 hours (or overnight). The
8. following day, strain the tea from the solids. Weigh the resulting liquid.
9. tarter. Blend these three ingredients together using an immersion blender. Once blended and
10. once the sugar has dissolved, blend in the strained Himalayan green tea to make everything homogeneous. Transfer this unfermented kombucha to gastro containers -2 L of liquid per
11. gastro. Find a perforated gastro of similar size, invert it, and rest it on top of the gastro filled with unfermented kombucha. Lay a cheesecloth across the top of this to prevent fruit flies. Byfermenting the kombucha in this manner, we want to maximize the surface area of the
12. kombucha to maximize the amount of SCOBY that we can yield.
