## Method

1. washed and skinned hazelnuts with the filtered water in the Thermomix for 25 seconds to break the nuts down and then transfer everything to the wet mill to grind for 25 minutes. After
2. pulp immediately, the milk will oxidize and thicken. The strained hazelnut milk should be
3. refrigerated after processing. It cannot be kept overnight because it thickens, thereby c hangin
4. e texture. If you have any left over, it can be frozen to be used at a future date (potentially for
5. 2.5 g rose pulp (reserved from Rose Oil* production)
6. Combine the cold- infused teas and kelp and cold -infuse overnight. Strain in the morning. Warm
7. the cold -infused teas and kelp to 70°C -no warmer than this or the flavor will oxidize. Add all
8. the other ingredients and leave to steep at room temperature for 1 hour. Once infused, strain,pressing the solids to maximize yield and flavor. Transfer the liquid to an atomizer for service.
9. In service, steam the crabs on a perforated gastro at 80°C (100% fan) for 17 to 18 minutes, depending o n the size of the crab. Allow the crabs to cool, then pick the meat from the shells.
10. Save any roe you may find for friendly portions. Each portion is 20 g, and we would preferably like to use as much claw meat as possible. Do not reserve the crab over ice, nor over a hot bain -
11. marie. The crab should be held at room temperature until plating.
12. The c rab s hould b e served at ro om t emperature. I t shouldn’t b e cold o r over ice. Place t he crab
13. in the center of the bowl. Season with 15 drops fresh barley koji oil, 12 drops shrimp garum, and
14. drops of the crab reduction. Season the crab with a few flakes of cold-i nfused kelp salt and
15. spoon approximately 15 to 20 g of the fresh hazelnut milk around the crab. Finish the dish with
16. or 5 sprays of the lapsang souchong and jasmine tea spray on the entire plate. If crab roe is available, plate that around the crab and serve immediately.
