## Method

1. sauce gun and scale, add the brain custard base to the deepest part of each skull, 12 g per portion. Set your skulls in the foil lined gastro, and carefully cover the entire gastro with plasticwrap to ensure that the custard base does no t get wet from the steamer.
2. Steam the skulls and brain custard at 80°C (80% fan) for 20 to 25 minutes. Due to the thicknessof the skulls -which can vary greatly -the timing of steaming is not exact. You will need to pay
3. attention and check each skull individually to ensure that the custard is cooked and set properly.The steamed custard should appear to have a wobble (similar to a panna cotta). Keep in mind that it will set further in the fridge.
4. Warm the pheasant broth until the gelled broth has fully melted, and season it to taste with th
5. regano vinegar and beef garum. You should barely be able to taste the vinegar, it is meant to
6. be a lightening background flavor. The beef garum is meant to make the base slightly meatier. Bloom the gelatin in cold water and add it to the warmed pheasant broth. Immediately proceedto setting the gel in the skull.
7. Steamed Brain Custard 6 g diced Braised Kelp
