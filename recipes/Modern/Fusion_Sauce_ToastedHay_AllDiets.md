## Method

1. Mix the passed purée with the pars ley oil, passed peaso, and Nordic shoyu. Place the purée into
2. a container and smoke it with a smoking gun and dried toasted hay three times, stirring the
3. purée between each smoking and keeping it in the fridge for 15 minutes per turn as well.
4. Reserve the s moked purée in a piping bag in the fridge until needed.
5. Set up a water bath with an immersion circulator set to 68 °C. Take half the eggs, place them in
6. the wa ter bath, and cook them for 20 minutes. With the remaining raw eggs, crack them, and
7. separate the yolks from the whites, being sure to keep the yolks whole. Place the raw yolks in a
8. plastic container and cover them with beef garum. Allow these egg yolks to cure in the liquid for
9. minutes. Remove the cured raw egg yolks from the shoyu and set them aside, covered. When
10. the timer goes off, remove the eggs and shock them in ice water. Once cooled, crack them, and
11. separate the yolks from the whites (you may need to rinse them gently under cold water to wash off any egg white still adhering to the yolk). Place them in the same garum and cure thes
12. ggs as well for 15 minutes. Once finished, remove the yolks, and transfer them to a mixing
13. bowl. Add the cured raw yolks, whisk them gently to mix thoroughly, and season the resulting
14. seasoning and texture.
15. Combine the egg yolk sauce with the parsley purée and mix them well to homogenize. Season this liquid heavily with the smoked seaweed shoyu to taste. Reserve the sauce in a piping bag
16. Dress the ground elder in clarified smoked butter, transfer it to a large tamis, and gently grill itover medium -hot coals until the leaves become crisp but not colored brown. Transfer the
17. ground elder to a paper towel -lined container to absorb any excess oil. Reserve in a low -
18. temp erature dehydrator until needed.
