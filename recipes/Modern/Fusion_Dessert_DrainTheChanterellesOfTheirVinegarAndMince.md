## Method

1. mortar and pestle, add the reductions, and then combine with the minced chanterelles. Reserve
2. In a pot on the stove, bring the oil up to 160°C. Once up to temperature, fry the leaves quickly
3. until they’re rendered translucent, clear, and crisp, and the bubbling has just stopped. Remove
4. as necessary to absorb any excess oil. Reserve.
5. Heat a 33 cm nonstick sauté pan on the stove over medium -high heat until almost smoking.
6. Measure out 200 mL of the milk and pour it into the pan. The milk should flash boil and start toreduce immediately. Lower the heat so that the milk reduces slowly, and as large bubbles form,
7. spray them with water from a spritz bottle to ensure an even reduction. As the liquid has almost
8. entirely evaporated, turn to heat to 1 to very slowly caramelize the solid skin that remains, being sure not to burn it. Once it’s lightly caramelized, spray it again with water to moisten it and render it pliable, and use a rubber spatula to carefully edge it away from the sides of the pan. Once it has loosened, pull the caramelized skin back with your fingers from the pan and transfer the skin to a sheet of parchment paper. Spray it with a bit of water, top it with anothersheet of parchment, clean the nonstick pan, and continue to make more skins. When the milk skins are finished, punch them out with a 10.2 cm ring mold, making sure to avoid any parts of the milk skin that have large pores or holes, or the pie wi ll not hold together when fried.
9. g Roasted Yeast Oil*
10. Thermomix. Once it comes together, proceed to add the oils until the mixture emulsifies like a mayonnaise. Do not pass it. Reserve the paste in a piping bag in the fridge until needed.
