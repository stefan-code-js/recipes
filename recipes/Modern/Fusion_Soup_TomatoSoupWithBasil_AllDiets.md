## Method

1. For most of the year, it’s hard to imagine worrying about an overabundance of ripe, juicy, sun-kissed tomatoes, but happily this is the case in August and early September, particularly for denizens of the Midwest, where the tomatoes are superb. I eat them raw and cooked; I oven-dry and can them. Those that get a little overripe end up in this soup, which is as tempting hot as it is chilled-and which I have never thought should be relegated to quick lunches only. This is an easy recipe that can be multiplied three or four times over for larger servings. Alter the flavor a little by using cilantro or flat-leaf parsley instead of basil.
2. tablespoon finely chopped onion
3. tablespoon finely chopped fresh basil, or 1½ teaspoons dried
4. Chopped fresh basil, for garnishing
5. Peel, core, and finely chop the tomatoes to measure 2 cups.
6. Melt the butter in a small saucepan over low heat. Add the onion and cook, stirring occasionally, for about 5 minutes or until the onion has softened but not colored.
7. Add the tomatoes and cook over low heat, partially covered, for 30 to 40 minutes or until the tomatoes are broken down and somewhat liquid. Stir occasionally while cooking. Stir in the 1 tablespoon of basil. Remove the pan from the heat and set aside to cool slightly.
8. Transfer the soup to a blender and puree until smooth. Strain through a
9. or fine-mesh sieve into a small bowl. Season to taste with salt and pepper. Reheat the soup gently if necessary.
10. Serve the warm tomato soup in small bowls or demitasse cups and garnish each serving with chopped fresh basil and a drizzle of olive oil.
