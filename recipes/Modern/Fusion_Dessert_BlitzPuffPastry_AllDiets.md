5. 1. sift the two flours together into a mixing bowl.
6. 2. Cut the butter into the flour as for pie dough, but
7. leave the fat in very large lumps, 1 in. (2.5 cm) across.
8. 3. dissolve the salt in the water.

15. Carbohydrates, 8 g; Fiber, 1 g; Sodium, 160 mg.
16. Reduce the butter to 75% (1 lb 8 oz/750 g).
17. 1. The dough should be cool and firm when it is rolled and cut. If it is too soft, the layers may stick together at the cuts, pre-venting proper rising.
18. 2. Cut with straight, firm, even cuts. Use a sharp cutting tool.
19. 3. Avoid touching the cut edges with your fingers; this can make the layers stick together.
20. 4. For best rising, place units upside down on baking sheets. Even sharp cutting tools may press the top layers of dough together. Baking upside down puts the stuck-together layers at the bottom.
21. 5. Avoid letting egg wash run down the edges. Egg wash can cause the layers to stick together at the edges.6. Rest made-up products for 30 minutes in a cool place or in the refrigerator before baking. This relaxes the gluten and reduces shrinkage.
22. 7. Press trimmings together, keeping the layers in the same direction. After being rolled out and given another three-fold, they may be used again, although they will not rise as high.
23. 8. Baking temperatures of 400°-425°F (200°-220°C) are best for most puff dough products. Cooler temperatures do not create enough steam in the products to leaven them well. Higher temperatures set the crust too quickly.
24. 1. Roll out puff pastry dough to 1⁄8 inch (3 mm) thick.
25. 2. Cut the dough into 4-inch (10-cm) squares. Wash the edges of each with water.
26. 3. Portion the desired filling into the center of each square.
27. 4. Fold diagonally and press the edges together.
28. 5. Puncture the tops with a knife in two or three places to allow steam to escape. Let rest 30 minutes.
29. 6. Brush the tops with egg wash, if desired, or brush with milk or water and sprinkle with sugar.
30. 7. Bake at 400°F (200°C) until crisp and brown.
