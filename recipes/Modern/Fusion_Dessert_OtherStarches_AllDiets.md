## Method

1. 1. Beurre manié (burr mahnyay) is a mixture of equal parts soft, raw butter and flour worked
2. together to form a smooth paste. It is used for quick thickening at the end of cooking to finish a
3. sauce. The raw butter adds flavor and gives a sheen to the sauce when it melts.
4. To use, drop very small pieces into a simmering sauce and stir with a whip until smooth.
5. Repeat until desired consistency is reached. simmer just a few minutes more to cook the flour, and then remove from the fire.
6. 2. Whitewash is a thin mixture of flour and cold water. sauces made with whitewash have neither as good a flavor nor as fine a texture as those made with roux. Whitewash is not
7. 3. Cornstarch produces a sauce that is almost clear, with a glossy texture.
8. To use, mix with cold water or other cold liquid until smooth. s tir into the hot liquid. Bring
9. to a boil and simmer until the liquid turns clear and there is no starchy taste. Do not boil for a long period or the starch may break down and the liquid become thin. s auces thickened with
10. cornstarch may thin out if held on the steam table for long periods. c ornstarch is used exten-
11. sively in sweet sauces to accompany certain meats as well as in desserts and dessert sauces. It has roughly twice the thickening power of flour.
12. 4. Arrowroot is used like cornstarch, but it gives an even clearer sauce. Its use is limited by its high cost. Nevertheless, because of its quality, it is the preferred starch for thickening jus lié. It is less
13. likely than cornstarch to break down when heated for a long time.
14. 5. Waxy maize is used for sauces that are to be frozen. Flour and other starches break down and lose their thickening power when frozen. Waxy maize does not. It is handled like cornstarch.
15. 6. Pregelatinized or instant starches have been cooked, or gelatinized, and then redried. Thus,
16. they can thicken a cold liquid without heating. These starches are rarely used in sauce making
17. but are frequently used in the bakeshop.
18. 7. Bread crumbs and other crumbs will thicken a liquid quickly because they have already been cooked, like instant starches. Bread crumbs may be used when smoothness of texture is not
19. desired. a common example is the use of gingersnap crumbs to thicken sauerbraten gravy.
20. 8. Vegetable purées, ground nuts, and other solids can also be used. a simple tomato sauce is
21. basically a seasoned vegetable purée. The sauce gets its texture from the thickness of the main ingredient. No additional thickener is needed.
22. using this same principle, we can add body or texture to sauces by adding a smooth vege -
23. table purée, or by puréeing mirepoix or other vegetables with the sauce. Other puréed or finely ground ingredients, such as ground nuts, add texture as well as flavor to a sauce.
24. In classical cooking, a liaison is a mixture of egg yolks and cream, used to enrich and lightly thicken a sauce or other liquid. e gg yolks have the power to thicken a sauce slightly due to the coagulation
25. of egg proteins when heated.
26. caution must be used when thickening with egg yolks because of the danger of curdling. This
27. happens when the proteins coagulate too much and separate from the liquid.
28. Pure egg yolks coagulate at 140°-158°F (60°-70°c ). For this reason, they are beaten with heavy
29. cream before use. This raises their curdling temperature to 180°-185°F (82°-85°c ). (Note this is still
30. well below the boiling point.) The heavy cream also adds thickness and flavor to the sauce.
31. cornstarch settles out and must be restirred
32. FIGURE 9.2 adding a liaison to a sauce.
33. (a) slowly stir a little of the hot sauce (chicken
34. velouté, in this photo) into the mixture of cream and egg yolks to warm it and dilute it.
35. (b) stir the tempered liaison back into the
36. 1. Beat together the egg yolks and cream in a stainless-steel bowl. Normal proportions are 2 to 3 parts cream to 1 part egg yolks.
37. 2. Very slowly, add a little of the hot liquid to the liaison, beating constantly. This is known as tempering.
38. 3. Off the heat, add the warmed, diluted liaison to the rest of the sauce, stirring well as you pour it in.
39. 4. Return the sauce to low heat to warm it gently, but do not heat it higher than 180°F (82°C) or it will curdle. Under no
40. circumstances should it boil.
41. 5. Hold for service above 135°F (57°C) for sanitation reasons, but lower than 180°F (82°C).
