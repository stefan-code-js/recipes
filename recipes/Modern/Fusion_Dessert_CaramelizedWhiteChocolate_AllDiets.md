## Method

1. a good chance that they will all caramelize the chocolate differently. Watch closely to ensure that you don’t burn any chocolate. Once caramelized, remove from the oven, and allow to cool,keeping in m ind that the chocolate will continue to cook after it’s removed from the oven. Onc
2. ool, transfer to an airtight container and reserve in the fridge.
3. Marigold Spice Mix
4. Put the bone marrow fudge in a piping bag, ensuring that it is fridge cold. Pipe a small line of the
5. fudge into the bottom of the bone. Place 6 small pieces of the caramelized white chocolate
6. evenly sp aced into the piped fudge. Once the white chocolate is in, pipe enough fudge into the
7. reindeer bone to fill it out -approximately 15 g. Transfer the bone to a blast freezer so that the
8. fudge sets and is easier to work with. Once set, use an offset spatula t o even out the surface of
9. the fudge (reserve this excess). Take a teaspoon or the back of a turning knife and drag it through the fudge to make a small trench in the fudge -approximately 1 mm deep. Clean the
10. edges of the bone to ensure that it looks sharp. Return the bone with the fudge to the blast chiller to cool down the fudge again.
11. In a yogurt pot, use a gloved hand to crush some of the freeze -dried blueberries. We do not
12. want them to be all broken, but we also don’t want them to be completely powdered. There should be large pieces of broken blueberry visible. Using a ½ L container lid (cut into the shapeof the bone), hold this stencil over the fudge -filled bone, and spread approximately 1 g of the
13. broken freeze- dried blueberries acr oss the top of the trenched fudge. Then spread a bit of the
14. marigold spice mix across the top of this. We want to cover the fudge completely with these twoseasonings. Use the plastic stencil to prevent the blueberries from discoloring the white reindeer b ones. Use a parchment square to gently press the blueberries and spice mix into the
15. fudge. Flip the bone upside down and shake it to release any excess seasonings. Once pressed and shaken, recheck the fudge, and fill any gaps of visible fudge with more fre eze-dried
16. blueberries. Once completely covered and seasoned, transfer the finished reindeer bones to a 1
17. L container to store in the freezer (at -20°C) until service.
