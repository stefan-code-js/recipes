- Twelve ounces smoked salmon
- Seven sheets gelatin

## Method

1. Put the salmon and 1¼ cups of the cream in a large saucepan. Add the ½ cup water and bring to a simmer over medium-high heat. As soon as the mixture simmers, remove from the heat.
2. Meanwhile, fill a large bowl with cold water. Gently drop the gelatin sheets into the water, several at a time, until all are submerged. Let soften and bloom for about 5 minutes.
3. Transfer the salmon and its cooking liquid to a blender and puree. You will have to do this in batches. Strain each batch through a
4. or fine-mesh sieve into a medium-sized bowl.
5. Using your hands, lift the gelatin sheets from the water and squeeze them gently between your fingers. Transfer to the salmon puree and stir gently until dissolved. Stir in the vinegar and season to taste with salt. Allow to cool to room temperature.
6. Beat the remaining 1¼ cups heavy cream in a chilled small bowl with chilled beaters until stiff peaks form.
7. Fold the whipped cream into the salmon mixture a third at a time, working quickly before it sets.
8. Spoon into a lightly greased, shallow 9-by-7-inch pan. Smooth the surface. Cover with plastic wrap and refrigerate for at least 4 hours and up to 8 hours.
9. Using a small sharp knife or a cookie cutter, cut the parfait into shapes.
10. To serve, gently lift the shapes from the pan with a thin-bladed spatula. Put 1 or 2 of the shapes on a small plate and drizzle a little chive oil around them. Garnish each with a little caviar and a sprig of chervil. Repeat to make 5 more servings.
11. Heat ¼ cup of the oil in a skillet over high heat until almost smoking. Add the chives and cook for 1 minute or until wilted. Remove from the heat and allow to cool.
12. Scrape the chives and any oil into a blender. Add just enough of the remaining oil so that the chives will spin when the blender is turned on. Blend for about 5 minutes or until the oil is thick, smooth, and evenly green. Strain the oil through a
13. or fine-mesh sieve into a small bowl.
14. Transfer the chive oil to a glass container, cover, and refrigerate for up to 3 days. The oil will turn brown, but the off color does not mean it is bad.
