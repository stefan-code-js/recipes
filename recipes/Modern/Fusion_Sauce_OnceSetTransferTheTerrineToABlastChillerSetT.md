## Method

1. will cook off and reduce by half, approximately.
2. To cook the portions during service, spray a wire rack with nonstick spray, and lay the portionson-6 portions per rack. Have the cooking glaze nearby. Grill the portions over low to medium
3. coals. Given that the celeriac is mostly cooked, what we aim to accomplish on the grill is a slowcaramelization over the coals. The glaze can be used liberally to ensure that there is enough
4. butter present to foam on the surface of the celeriac. Spray another wire rack with nonstick spray and place it upside down on the portions. Holding both wire racks with kitchen towels, carefully flip the two together with the portions in between. Continue cooking and glazing this
5. side of the portions. At least twice during the process, add sprigs of Douglas fir onto the coals to
6. smoke the shawarma portions gently. This cooking process will take approxima tely 35 to 45
7. minutes, but potentially longer depending on the temperature of your grill and how even theheat distribution is. Once well caramelized on both sides, use an offset spatula to carefully remove the portions and reserve them on a parchment-line d drop tray until called out in

12. caramelize. Once both sides of the apples have taken proper color, remove them from the heatand reserve.
13. Chopped black truffle
14. In a pot, combine the reduced mushroom -kelp broth and the truffle juice. The sauce needs to
15. to coat the back of a spoon. Adjust with the two base ingredients to achieve this texture. Onc
16. ou’ve attained the desired texture, season the sauce lightly with white wine vinegar and
17. reduced white wine to taste. Slowly heat the sauce and add the brown butter. The ratio should
