## Method

1. should be sliced as thinly as possible while still getting whole slices. Once all the celeriac is sliced, make stacks of 6 or 7 slices, and place them into c ooking bags. Mix the canned truffle
2. juice and brown butter at a 1:1 ratio to make a cooking liquid. Pour enough of this cooking liquidinto the bags to coat the vegetable slices- the celeriac should not be swimming. Vacuum seal
3. the bags at 100% and steam in a combi oven set to 95°C (100% steam) for 15 minutes. Once
4. cooked, shock the bags in ice water. Once cooled, open the bags, and remove the celeriac slices.
5. Wash the celeriac and bake them at 200°C (100% fan), skin on, for 40 to 60 minutes, or until
6. very tender all the way through. Cool the celeriac down, peel the skin off, and weigh the cooked
7. flesh. For every 250 g celeriac flesh, you will use 50 g brown butter and 25 mL canned truffle
8. juice, and salt to season. Blend the flesh with the other ingredients in the Thermomix until you reach a smooth purée. Remove the purée without passing it and reserve.
9. Toast the linseeds in an oven at 160°C (100% fan) for 30 minutes, stirring them every 10 minutesor so. Once toasted, remove them from the oven, pass them through a preheated nut press, and
10. collect the oil (you can discard the pulp). Reserve the oil vacuum sealed in the freezer until
11. g Roasted Kelp Salt* 35 g Celery Juice Reduction*
12. Crush the kelp salt with a mortar and pestle and add the reductions, followed by the oil, and finally the brown butter. Reserve in the fridge until needed.
