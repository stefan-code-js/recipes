As the liquid has almostentirely evaporated, turn to heat to 1 to very slowly caramelize the solid skin that remains, being sure not to burn it. Once it’s lightl y caramelized, spray it again with water to moisten it
4. and render it pliable, and use a rubber spatula to carefully edge it away from the sides of the pan. Once it has loosened, pull the caramelized skin back with your fingers from the pan and
