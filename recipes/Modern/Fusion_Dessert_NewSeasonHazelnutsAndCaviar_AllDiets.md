1. hem to a pressure cooker with the water. Secure the lid of the p ressure cooker and transfer it
2. to the stove. Set the induction burner to setting 5 and wait for steam to release from the pressure cooker. Once it begins to steam, turn the induction burner down to setting 2 and cook
3. them together for 15 minutes, starting the timer from the moment the pressure cooker begins
4. releasing steam. Once cooked, let the pressure cooker rest for 15 minutes before releasing thepressure and removing the lid. (Alternatively, you can transfer the pressure cooker to a sink andrun cold w ater over the lid if you want to depressurize it faster.) Carefully open the pressure
5. cooker and strain the mixture through a fine -mesh nylon sieve, reserving both the cooking liquid
6. Place the cooked chestnuts into the Thermomix and beg in puréeing them on speed 8. As the
7. blender spins, pour in a bit of the reserved cooking liquid until the mixture is just loose enoughto purée in a vortex. Adjust the seasoning with salt. Once well puréed (approximately 10
8. minutes), pass the mixture throu gh a tamis lined with a fine -mesh nylon sieve, making sure that
9. the texture is not too thick. It should have the viscosity of a light mousse. Place the purée into
10. piping bags and reserve at room temperature for service.
11. Remove the crown of the hazelnut but leave it in its shell. Place the nuts into three times their
12. weight in salt brine in a vacuum bag and seal the bag on maximum. Store the salted nuts in the
13. fridge until needed. When needed, remove the nuts from the salt brine by draining them off. Crack the nuts out of their shells and then peel off their skin. Purge the nuts in 4 times their weight in ice water in the fridge overnight. The following day, remove them from the ice water,dry them off, and slice the hazelnuts with a mandolin at a thickness of 1 mm, being sure to slice
14. perpendicular to the natural seam in the nut. Reserve them in a parchment -lined container
15. covered with a light coating of hazelnut oil to prevent them from discoloring . You will need
