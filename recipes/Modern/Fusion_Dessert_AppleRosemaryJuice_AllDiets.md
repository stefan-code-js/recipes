## Method

1. If I were going to bottle anything for commercial sale, this would be it. Not only is this juice my personal favorite, but discovering how a little rosemary rounds out apple juice so that it is cleanly refreshing as well as complex was a glorious surprise. The juice is practically clear, so the first sip is an intense revelation-your guests will be delighted! For a tint of color, add a little green or red apple peel to the simmering juice. Coming to a store near you soon!
2. Combine the lemon juice and water in a small nonreactive bowl. Core and quarter the apples and place in the acidulated water.
3. in a juicer to measure 2 cups. Skim any foam or impurities from the surface of the juice and discard. Transfer the juice to a small saucepan. Add the rosemary and bring to a simmer over medium-high heat. As soon as the juice simmers, remove from the heat and allow to steep for 1 hour.
4. Skim and discard any foam from the surface of the mixture.
5. Strain through a coffee filter into a large pitcher and allow the juice to come to room temperature. Cover and refrigerate for 2 hours or until chilled. Season to taste with salt and pepper.
6. Stir before pouring into small, chilled glasses for serving.
