## Method

1. Pot roasts usually require about 2 oz (60 mL) sauce per portion, and this determines the
2. amount of liquid needed. The size of the braising pot used should allow the liquid to cover the meat by one-third to two-thirds. The top portion of the meat not covered by liquid is cooked with the aid of the steam held in the covered pot.
3. Stews usually require enough liquid to cover the meat.Some items are braised with no added liquid. They are browned, then covered, and the item
4. cooks in its own moisture, which is trapped by the pan lid. Pork chops are frequently cooked in this way. If roasted, sautéed, or pan-fried items are covered during cooking, they become, in effect, braised items.
5. 4. Vegetable garnish.Vegetables to be served with the meat may be cooked along with the meat or cooked separately and added before service.
6. cooking for them to be cooked through but not overcooked.
7. 5. Stovetop or oven.Braising may be done on the range or in the oven. Oven-braising has three major advantages:
8. • Uniform cooking. The heat strikes the braising pot on all sides, not just the bottom.
9. • Less attention required. Foods braise at a low, steady temperature without having to be checked constantly.
10. • Range space is free for other purposes.
11. 6. Adjusting the sauce.

13. 1. Braised items should be fork-tender. the interior should be juicy.
14. 2. although tender, braised foods should maintain their shape and not be falling apart.
15. 3. Braised foods should have a well-developed, concentrated flavor due to long cooking in fla-
16. vorful liquids. thin flavor may be caused by insufficient cooking or cooking at the wrong tem-
17. perature, so liquids didn’t have time to reduce and concentrate.
18. 4. Braised foods should have an attractive color developed from proper browning or searing at
19. the beginning of the cooking process and from long cooking in concentrated liquids.
