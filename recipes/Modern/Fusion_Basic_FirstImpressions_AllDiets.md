## Method

1. The neighborhood where the bakery was located had the highest population density of
2. any place between Seattle and San Francisco. But the neighborhood was filled with
3. modest rental apartments, and the per capita income data concerned me. I was going to
4. compete on quality, not price. We opened just two months after September 11. During a
5. recession. And the carb-fearing Atkins and South Beach diets were peaking in
6. popularity. Portland set a record for most consecutive days with measurable rain. The
7. unemployment rate was around 12 percent at the time. Today, an ambitious bakery
8. opening would get instant media attention. At that time it barely got a mention. So we had
9. with curious passersby and a few drunks.
10. idealized vision. Now, I tend to remember the things that went wrong more than the
11. things that went right. Our first sheeter, used to laminate croissant and puff pastry dough,
12. was too small. Making it work required that we prop boards on overturned trash cans at
13. either end to catch the dough as it ran back and forth between the rollers. The
14. were inconsistent, but when they were on they were fantastic. We were baking all of our
15. pans gave us all a series of nasty accidental sheet pan burns on our forearms.

17. pastry work, and baked levain breads that had been chilled overnight. Then I divided,
18. shaped, and baked baguettes, with the first batch coming out of the oven around 8:30 a.m.
