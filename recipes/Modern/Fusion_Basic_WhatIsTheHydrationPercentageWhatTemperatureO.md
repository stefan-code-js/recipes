## Method

1. way to ferment the dough? What temperatures are specified for dough mix, bulk
2. Two recipes that look alike can in fact be quite different. Always consider the balance
3. evaluating recipes. Remember the warm-dough-less-yeast/cold-dough-more-yeast
4. Jim Lahey’s famous no-knead bread recipe. But let’s take a
5. deeper look. This comparison isn’t about which method or bread is better; it’s just
6. fuss mix of a soft dough with a small amount of yeast in the evening; shaping into loaves
7. the next morning; and baking in a Dutch oven an hour or two later. However, when you
8. compare our ingredient ratios using baker’s percentages, or when you compare the
9. specified water temperatures, it’s easy to see the differences. In terms of ingredients, my
10. water temperature is at least 30°F (about 16°C) warmer, resulting in a final mix
11. temperature that’s about 18°F (10°C) warmer. As for differences in technique, I call for
12. half after mixing the dough. My recipe takes a little bit more work, but not much.
13. I write this comparison to Mr. Lahey’s well-known bread recipe to show that the
14. recipes’ baker’s percentages, temperatures, and timelines. Seeing that my bread, which
15. is made on the same schedule, uses one-third the amount of yeast and is mixed with much
16. and the temperature of the dough. My dough benefits from a few folds to give it strength.
