- CREAMING AND RUBBING IN: GETTING THEM RIGHT

## Method

1. These doughs are light-textured and not elastic. When making them, it is important to avoid activating the gluten in the flour as this would make the dough stretchy, difficult to roll out, and it would shrink when baked. Two techniques are used to prevent the dough becoming elastic: rubbing in, which incorporates the butter
2. into the flour, and creaming, where butter, sugar, and eggs are beaten together. The two methods produce
3. different textures, with rubbed in pastries being more crumbly, and creamed ones being crisper.
4. When making pastry by the creaming method, the temperature of the ingredients is very important. Butter must be softened and eggs at room temperature but although the butter and sugar are emulsified, you are not making mayonnaise. Combine them at low speed so as not to beat in too much air, as this would make the dough fragile, and it would lose its shape during baking. For rubbing in, it is better to use the paddle beater of your mixer rather than your hands to avoid melting the butter, which should be cold and diced beforehand.
5. As these doughs are light they must not be overworked once the flour has been incorporated. To combine ingredients means just that-so no kneading! The best way to ensure a smooth dough is to work the ingre -
6. dients together with your hand, without using undue pressure. The French verb for this technique is fraser.
7. When making flaky pastries, the chilling stage is essential as it gives the butter in the dough time to firm up again. A dough that is too cold will crack and be difficult to roll out, while a dough that is too soft will be hard to handle, so follow the chilling times given in the recipe. To ensure your dough chills rapidly and evenly, flatten it into a disk rather than shape it into a ball, as this will make it much easier to roll out. Cover the dough in plastic wrap before placing it in the refrigerator.
8. A light dusting of flour, barely visible to the eye, is all that’s needed. Chilling the rolling pin will also help keep the dough cold and prevent it becoming sticky. Should this happen, simply re-wrap the dough and return it to the refrigerator to firm up again. It’s better than adding flour as that would dry out the dough.
9. The thickness of the rolled-out dough depends on how it will be used and for how long you plan to keep it. A blind baked pastry crust does not need rolling out as thinly as one filled with almond cream. The longer you store the tart crust, the thicker it should be.
