## Method

1. PETIT FOUR COOKIES, AND SIMPLE DESSERTS
2. to make but still require as much care and attention to detail to ensure success every time.
3. It can’t be said often enough: cakes and pastries cannot be made with eggs straight from the refrigerator! So, get into the routine of taking your eggs out of the refrigerator at least 2 hours before you need them.
4. When making everyday cakes, eggs at room temperature can be beaten in perfectly, without firming up the butter or making the batter curdle. For mousses and other simple desserts that contain egg whites, the whites will whisk up more easily and the sugar will dissolve better.
5. For light, well-risen cakes, beating the butter and sugar together correctly is essential. This incorporates air bubbles, which are produced as the butter rubs against the sugar crystals, aerating the batter. Beat for 3-4 minutes to reach the right consistency, keeping the ingredients in contact with the whisk all the
6. time and regularly stopping and scraping down the sides of the bowl with a spatula to ensure the batter remains smooth.
7. Sifting dry ingredients together distributes the raising agent evenly throughout the flour so both can be incorporated without overworking the dough or batter. This limits the development of the gluten and air bubbles remain in the batter, which is important for ensuring soft cakes.
8. Cake batters that contain baking powder must be baked immediately, as the raising agent begins to act and produce carbon dioxide as soon as it is added. For maximum rise, bake your cakes as soon as you’ve made the batter.
9. AN EVEN BAKE
10. Carefully buttering the cake pan is important, but it’s even better if done with clarified butter. There is no danger of this burning and the sides of your cake will color evenly without darkening too much.
11. Some recipes, such as financiers and madeleines, are made with melted butter, but for added flavor, continue cooking the melted butter until it turns golden brown- beurre noisette (hazelnut butter) in French. Strain
12. the butter, add it according to your recipe, and it will give the cake a lovely nutty flavor. cakes on the move
