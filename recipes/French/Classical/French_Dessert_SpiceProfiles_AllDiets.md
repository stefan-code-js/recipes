3. Pods are scalded or steamed, then sweated in sealed containers to make them release defensive phenol molecules. These react with the air and destructive plant enzymes to disintegrate into dark, flavourful compounds. Pods are then dried until black and shrivelled to one-fifth their original weight.
4. 1,000 years ago on the eastern coast of Mexico by the T otonac people. The first recorded use as a flavouring dates to the 15th century CE, when the Aztecs conquered the T otonacs, discovered the bean-like fruit, and used it to flavour cacao drinks. The Spanish conquistador Cortés was served just such a drink by the Aztec king in 1519 and took vanilla pods and cacao beans back to Spain. But Mexico retained a monopoly because the pods would only form when pollinated by native orchid bees. That is until the 1830s, when a Belgian botanist unravelled the mystery and devised a technique of hand pollination. In 1874, German chemists created a synthetic alternative to the natural flavour, and now 97 per cent of vanilla-flavoured foods are made with synthetic vanillin.Spice story
