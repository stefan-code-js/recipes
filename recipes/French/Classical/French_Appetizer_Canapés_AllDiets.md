## Method

1. 1. You may use ready-sliced bread (after trimming the crusts), but it is
2. usually most efficient to use long, unsliced pullman loaves. Cut the crusts from all sides (save for bread crumbs). Cut the bread horizon-tally into slices ¼ inch (6 mm) thick, as shown in Figure 24.1.
3. 2. Toast the slices in the oven or in a large toaster.
4. 3. Let the toasts cool.
5. 4. Cover with a thin, even layer of the chosen spread and cut into desired shapes with a knife (Fig. 24.2). Make the cuts neat and uniform.
6. and reserve the trim for bread crumbs. Spread each cutout with desired topping. (This method is more time-consuming, but it may be used with round or odd-shaped cutters if you want to save food cost by not losing spread on unused trimmings.)
7. 5. Garnish the cutouts as desired.
8. 1. Cut bread slices as in step 1 above.
9. 2. Cut into desired shapes. Brush both sides of each cutout with melted butter and arrange on sheet pans. Place in a hot oven (450°F/230°C) until golden brown and very crisp, 6 to 8 minutes.
10. 3. Let the bases cool.
11. 4. Assemble the canapés.
12. FIGURE 24.2 Bread slices for canapés can be cut into
13. several basic shapes with no waste.
14. FIGURE 24.1 For canapés, trim the crusts from
15. a pullman loaf. With a serrated knife, cut the loaf
16. horizontally into thin slices.
