## Method

1. Combine the prunes, orange zest, brandy, and simple syrup in a small saucepan. Season to taste with salt. Bring to a gentle boil over medium-high heat. Reduce the heat and simmer gently, partly covered, for about 20 minutes or until the prunes are plump and tender but not mushy.
2. Using a slotted spoon, remove the prunes from the liquid and transfer them to a small bowl to cool. Cut the prunes into halves or quarters.
3. Continue to simmer the cooking liquid very gently over low heat for 3 to 5 minutes or until it reaches a syruplike consistency. Pour the syrup into another small bowl or a pitcher to cool.
4. Cut the greens off the turnips, leaving a small decorative piece attached to each turnip.
5. In a large pot of boiling salted water, blanch the turnips for 10 to 15 minutes or until tender. Drain and immediately submerge in cold water to stop the cooking. Drain again.
6. Melt the butter in a small sauté pan over medium-high heat. When the butter is melted, add the turnips and sauté for 5 to 8 minutes or until nicely browned all over. Remove from the heat and cut each turnip lengthwise into quarters. Return to the pan and keep warm until ready to serve.
7. In a medium-sized bowl, whisk together the milk, egg, and cinnamon and a pinch of salt until blended. Pour into a shallow bowl or small gratin dish.
8. Lightly grease a large nonstick skillet or sauté pan and place over medium-high heat.
9. Dip both sides of 3 slices of the brioche into the milk mixture. Let them sit in the mixture for only a few seconds; do not let the mixture saturate the slices completely. Using a slotted spatula, transfer the soaked bread to the skillet and cook for 1 to 1½ minutes on each side or until golden. Transfer each piece of French toast to a small plate. Soak and cook the remaining brioche.
10. Garnish each serving of French toast with turnip quarters, prunes, and a drizzle of the brandy-prune syrup. Serve immediately.
