## Method

1. cubes, for example, makes it easier to mix into doughs and batters.
2. Beaten raw egg (sometimes mixed with a liquid like water, milk,
3. or cream) that is brushed onto pastry or bread before baking to promote browning and add shine. A pastry brush with soft bristles is the best tool for applying a thin, even coat.
4. A smooth, uniform blend of two liquids that do not naturally mix, such as oil and water. Making an emulsion requires vigorous hand whisking or blending in a food processor or blender.
5. This breaks one of the liquids down into tiny droplets and disperses it throughout the other liquid, forming a temporary suspension. Adding an emulsifier like egg yolk stabilizes the emulsion.
6. Mainly found in professional kitchens, this oven can be set to a wide range of very precise temperatures, rising to a maximum of 572°F (300°C ). It is used for drying or steaming delicate
7. ingredients and also for proofing (proving) yeast doughs.
8. Fine crispy flakes of crushed Gavottes cookies with a caramelized
9. praline flavor, known as pailleté feuilletine in French.
10. They are often used in layered cakes to add a crunchy texture. If these are unavailable, crushed wafers can be substituted.
11. over a warm dish, igniting it, and allowing the flame to burn out. This process eliminates most of the alcohol and intensifies the flavors of the dish. For safety reasons, it is best to use a long match or long-reach lighter.
12. A gentle technique for blending a light and airy mixture into a heavier one, or vice versa, without stirring or beating. This prevents the lighter mixture (such as whisked egg whites) from deflating excessively and making the baked goods dense or chewy. G
13. Covering a pastry or cake with a smooth, shiny layer. Glazes can either be transparent-such as apricot jam and nappage (clear
14. neutral glaze)-or opaque-like chocolate glaze or the fondant icing typically used on eclairs. Pastry chefs also sprinkle their pastries with confectioners’ sugar before baking, or brush them with simple syrup when fresh out of the oven to create a glossy finish.
15. the flavor and aroma. The resulting infusion can be used to flavor preparations like buttercream, pastry cream, and ganache.
16. In most cases, the liquid must be strained before use.
17. The action of blending, massaging, and working a mixture
18. containing flour with your hands to obtain a smooth, elastic dough. Kneading develops the gluten in the dough, resulting in lighter and airier baked goods.
19. and rolling out multiple times to produce thin alternating layers of fat and dough, resulting in light and flaky pastries. Both puff pastries and croissants are made with laminated dough.
20. juice, or liquor to soften them and boost their flavor.
21. Covering a cake with a thin, smooth layer of buttercream, marzipan, ganache, etc. The purpose of masking is to conceal
22. the cake underneath, but it also secures any loose crumbs and hides imperfections, making the surface of the cake perfectly smooth before a final layer of icing or rolled fondant is applied.
23. A technique for adding moisture and flavor to baked goods with simple syrup, alcohol, liqueur, or milk. The liquid should be
