## Method

1. most widely used in cooking and baking. Potato starch, as the name implies, is extracted from potatoes, and it can be used in place of cornstarch in many recipes. Both cornstarch and potato starch are fine white powders that thicken when heated, and both are gluten-free.
2. Custard powder is a blend of cornstarch, sugar, vanilla flavoring, and a touch of yellow coloring. It gives custard-based desserts and sauces like flan and pastry cream a particularly rich and creamy texture.
3. Walnuts, hazelnuts, almonds, pistachios, and chestnuts are among the most flavorful nuts and they are basic ingredients in pastry making. Used whole, powdered, or in paste or oil form, they provide pastry chefs with a wide range of delectable tastes and textures.
4. storage tips: Nuts are high in fat, which makes them particularly susceptible to going rancid. It is
5. therefore best to purchase nuts as you need them rather than store them. If you have nuts left over, keep them in an airtight container, preferably in the refrigerator or freezer. Otherwise, store them in a cool, dry place away from sunlight. Pine nuts, Brazil nuts, macadamia nuts, and pecans should be stored in the same manner.
6. Whether ground, sliced, slivered, chopped, or whole (blanched or unblanched), almonds play a key role in a number of French pastries, including galettes des rois (kings’ cake), financiers, macarons, and more.
7. as you need them. Most almond varieties are sweet, which are best for pastry making, but there are some bitter varieties, typically used to make almond extract.
8. This is made by grinding blanched (skinned) whole almonds very finely. If you have trouble buying almond flour-available from whole food stores and online-ground almonds (almond meal) can be substituted. The results will not be quite as fine, as ground almonds are produced by milling the nuts with their skins left on to produce a slightly coarser meal.
9. both terms refer to the same product in the UK. Marzipan has more sugar and less almonds than almond paste, and it has a smooth, malleable texture. It is used principally for decorating, as it can be modeled into decorative shapes or rolled into a thin, fondant-like layer to cover cakes. Products labeled “almond paste” in the US contain more almonds and less sugar than marzipan, so they are less sweet and have a coarser texture. Almond paste works better for filling tarts or pastries or for blending into other ingredients. Both marzipan and almond paste can be purchased ready-to-use from specialty shops or online. Almond pastes with a higher ratio of almonds to sugar will have a superior taste to pastes with more sugar than almonds, but they will also be more expensive and will not keep as well.
