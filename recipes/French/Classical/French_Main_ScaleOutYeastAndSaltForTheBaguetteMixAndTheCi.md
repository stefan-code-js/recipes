## Method

1. Scale out yeast and salt for the baguette mix and the ciabatta mix. Dump the
2. poolish, mixed the previous afternoon, into the bread mixer. Depending on the day
3. and the size of the mix, that’s between three and six tubs of poolish, which should
4. that give the top surface the appearance of tapioca. If you stare at it, you can see
5. occasional little eruptions as bubbles pop on the surface. The classic French
6. method for removing the poolish is to reserve some of the water for the mix to pour
7. the mixing bowl easily enough, especially with a little encouragement from a hand
8. and a plastic dough scraper. Add the fresh yeast and salt.
9. Begin the baguette mix, on first speed. Set timer for 5 minutes. Take empty
10. poolish tubs to the dish pit and rinse them out. Grab a bunch of empty dough tubs
11. and a bar towel, take them to the baker’s bench, and oil the seven or more dough
12. tubs needed for the finished baguette dough.
13. Timer goes off. Change the mixer to second speed and set timer for 4

17. the day’s mix sheet. Record the mix temperature and the time the mix was
18. completed on the mix sheet. Plan on cutting the dough set aside for the morning bake
19. Feed the levain, which was last mixed the previous afternoon and is now
20. bubbly, acidic, leathery smelling, and generally nasty. First, throw all but a small
21. amount from the levain into the trash. We handle the levain at this stage wearing
22. sensitive spots (I used to get small lesions and splits on my fingertips). The
23. hundred loaves of bread, but it does-yeast puts rabbits to shame. Add a few kilos
24. of flour and very warm water to the tub and mix the levain by hand.
25. Autolyse the ciabatta dough. Once again waddle with tubs of cold water
