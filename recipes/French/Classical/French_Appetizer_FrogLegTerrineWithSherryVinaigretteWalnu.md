## Method

1. You’ve probably heard that frogs’ legs taste like chicken. It’s true. As a child, I contentedly ate them whenever my grandmother cooked them-floured, dipped in eggs, sautéed, and then served with a spicy tomato sauce. I always liked them that way, but the first time I tasted plump, lean frogs’ legs sautéed with garlic and herbs, I knew I was tasting something remarkable. For this reason, I categorize frogs’ legs with escargot and French onion soup: You can’t believe how good they are until you try them. I’m indebted to Chef Nico Lidenis of Nico’s restaurant in London, who taught me a lot of great ways to serve frogs’ legs when I did a stage there.
2. For this amuse, I make a terrine from the meat of the frogs’ legs, gently flavored with butter, garlic, white wine, and parsley. I serve it with a light sherry vinaigrette sprinkled over crunchy frisée and garnished with walnuts.
3. It’s not unusual to find frogs’ legs in a supermarket, and surely a good fish merchant can get them for you. Like chicken, they freeze well, so if you think you might want to try this, buy the frogs’ legs when you see them and stow them in the freezer.
4. Nonstick cooking spray
5. tablespoons finely chopped fresh parsley
6. Frisée lettuce, for garnishing
7. Rinse the frogs’ legs. Split each pair of legs through the joint. Remove the meat from the bones and reserve the meat and bones separately.
8. Heat 1 tablespoon of the butter in a medium-sized sauté pan or skillet over medium heat. When the butter is hot, add the leg bones and sauté for 6 to 8 minutes or until golden brown.
9. Pour off the butter and add the wine to the pan. Increase the heat and bring to a boil while scraping the bottom of the pan with a wooden spoon. Add the water and reduce the heat to a simmer. Simmer over very low heat for about 15 minutes or until reduced by half.
10. Remove from the heat and strain the contents of the pan through a
11. or fine-mesh sieve into a shallow bowl. Discard the bones. Season the broth to taste with salt and pepper and set aside to cool to room temperature.
12. Wipe out the sauté pan and add the remaining 1 tablespoon butter. Melt over medium-low heat. Add the reserved meat and garlic and cook gently for about 5 minutes or until the meat is cooked through and tender.
13. Remove from the heat and put the meat in a medium-sized bowl. Season to taste with salt and pepper and set aside to cool to room temperature.
14. Lightly coat a long, shallow, 1-cup terrine mold, approximately 3 inches long and 2 inches wide, with nonstick cooking spray and line with plastic wrap, leaving 3-inch overhangs on the long sides of the terrine.
15. Remove any fat from the surface of the broth and discard. Add the broth and parsley to the leg meat and mix well. Transfer the mixture to the prepared terrine.
16. Place the mold on a rimmed tray to catch any overflow of juices. Fold the overhanging ends of the plastic wrap over the top of the terrine and set a piece of foil-lined lightweight cardboard, cut to fit inside the mold, on top of the plastic wrap. Place a weight, such as a soup can laid on its side, on top of the cardboard and refrigerate for at least 8 hours.
17. Preheat the oven to 350°F.
18. Spread the nuts in a single layer on a baking sheet or in a jelly-roll pan and toast for about 10 minutes or until the nuts are lightly browned and fragrant. Shake the pan 2 or 3 times while the nuts are toasting. Transfer the nuts to a plate to cool to room temperature. Chop them coarsely. Store in a covered container until ready to use.
19. Put the sherry wine vinegar in a small bowl and whisk in the olive oil until blended. Season to taste with salt and pepper.
20. To serve, use the plastic wrap to lift the terrine from the mold. Unwrap and cut the terrine into ¼-inch slices. Place the slices on a work surface and use a small cookie cutter to trim the slices into perfect rounds. Lay 1 round on a small plate and garnish with toasted walnuts, cherry tomatoes, and frisée lettuce. Drizzle with some sherry vinaigrette. Repeat to make 5 to 9 more servings.
