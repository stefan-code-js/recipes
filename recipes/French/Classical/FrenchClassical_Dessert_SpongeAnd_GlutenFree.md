## Method

1. - the egg whites must be thoroughly whisked, but not until they are
2. very stiff and dry. They should hold their shape in peaks and have the consistency of shaving foam, so they can be folded easily into the batter. This ensures the sponge rises well in the oven and has a soft, light texture.
3. spoon, as in the past they were shaped with a spoon. The practice of piping them using a pastry bag only began in 1820 .
4. Pale Y et Properly Baked
5. As ladyfingers are dusted generously with confectioners’ sugar, it is not always easy to check the sponge is fully baked by just looking at the tops. The best way is to carefully lift the parchment and peep underneath. If the sponge is lovely and golden, it is ready. Take care not to overbake as the ladyfingers will quickly become crumbly.
6. Dacquois are residents of the town of Dax in southwest France and they’ve given their name to this classic cake, but dacquoise refers to the name of the base layers of nut meringue used to make the cake as well. The cake is also known as Palois , a reference to the inhabitants of the
7. nearby city of Pau, in the same region. The meringue layers are sand -
8. wiched with buttercream and then dusted with confectioners’ sugar.
9. For a fuller flavor, roast the ground nuts (hazelnuts or almonds) before folding them into the batter.
10. You can bake genoise sponge batter on a parchment-lined baking sheet, or alternatively in a round cake pan and cut it into thin layers once it has cooled. The latter is especially useful if your batter is too runny to spread over a baking sheet.
11. If baking your genoise on a lined baking sheet, as soon as it is ready, slide it carefully onto a wire rack, still on the parchment, and let it cool completely. This will make the sponge easier to handle and to peel off the paper, without damaging its thin, golden crust.
12. Parchment paper used to line a baking sheet can blow around in the oven so needs sticking to the sheet to hold it in place. The easiest way is to dab a little batter at each corner of the parchment and place it upside down on the sheet-the batter will act as the ideal glue and it’s food-safe and heatproof!
