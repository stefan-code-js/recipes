## Method

1. If you want to add sausage, cut a warmed link into coins and impale them on the end of the fork’s tines. Lentils are legumes that cook quickly without presoaking, which makes them endlessly versatile. They are smaller and flatter than other legumes and may be yellow, brown, black, green, or mottled. The small green French lentils known as Le Puy are considered to be the finest example.
2. ¼ cup warm cooked orange lentils (see
3. ¼ cup warm cooked black lentils
4. ¼ cup warm cooked French green lentils
5. sprigs fresh chervil or flat-leaf parsley, for garnishing
6. Combine the lentils in a medium-sized bowl and toss gently with the truffle vinaigrette. Season to taste with salt and pepper.
7. To serve, spoon about 2 tablespoons of the truffled lentils onto a decorative spoon, such as a long-handled iced tea spoon. Set the spoon on a small plate and drizzle the bacon vinaigrette over and around the “truffles.” Garnish each with a sprig of chervil. Repeat to make 5 more servings.
