## Method

1. EGG WHITE MIX
2. Combine both ingredients until well mixed, being sure not to whip the egg whites. Reserve in
3. Egg White Mix
4. Disconnect the lower jawbones from the cod heads and separate the two bones that attach to the base of the tongue. The tongue is attached to a wishbone-shaped bone, and to separate thetwo prongs, the tongue needs to be cut in half, straight down th e middle. Use a kitchen towel
5. and a petty knife to French the bones properly, leaving no nerves attached. You will also need toremove the membrane surrounding the tongue. Once cleaned, place the tongues in a vacuum bag with 1 g of Douglas fir oil per tong ue portion in the bag. Seal the bag on maximum and cook
6. it in a steam oven at 90°C (100% fan) for 10 minutes. Once cooked, shock the bag in ice water. Once cool, remove the tongues from the bag and dry them with a clean towel. Dredge the flesh of the tongu es in rice flour, then the well- beaten egg white mix, and finally the panko, while
7. keeping the bones clean. Reserve the portions in an airtight container on parchment for service.
8. Work the green strawberries in a mortar with the pestle until ground, then slowly incorporate the oil until loosely emulsified. The paste still needs to be slightly chunky. Reserve in the fridge until needed but temper the paste for service.
9. Temper the tongues for 30 minutes before service. Preheat a rondeau of grapeseed oil to 175°C. Fry the cod tongues for 40 to 45 seconds, w hile suspending the frenched bone out of the oil,
10. until they crisp up and turn lightly golden brown. Remove them from the fryer and dry the tongues on a C -fold towel- lined drop tray. Season the tongues with salt, brush it with the lacto
11. green strawberry pa ste, and finish it with 10 to 12 freshly picked wasabi flowers. Serve on a
12. napkin- lined plate with a quarter of frozen and thawed Japanese quince .
