## Method

1. It’s not surprising that I fell in love with French soups, such as onion and lentil, when I lived in England and was able to travel to France so often. My regular excursions gave credence to the old joke that the best thing about England is France! So many of those old-time, rustic soups are flavored with ham bones and other parts of the hog, pork cuts people shy away from nowadays. I understand why, but I also think it’s a shame, since the pork provides such depth and pulls the flavors together. I use everyday bacon here, which admittedly is so tasty because it’s about 50 percent fat! If you see a recipe calling for cured pork belly, you can use bacon-it’s the same thing. For me, this soup is the ultimate comfort food. I like to serve it as an amuse, although it’s wonderful in larger amounts. You can turn it into a meal by adding crabmeat, chicken, or rich Italian or Polish sausage. It’s good eats!
2. ounce bacon, very finely diced
3. tablespoon finely chopped onion
4. tablespoon finely chopped carrot
5. tablespoon finely chopped celery
6. Put the bacon in a small saucepan over low heat and cook until the fat is rendered and the bacon begins to cook. Increase the heat and continue to cook until the bacon is crisp and golden brown. Remove the bacon with a slotted spoon to a small plate and reserve. Leave the bacon fat in the pan.
7. Add the onion, carrot, and celery to the saucepan. Cook over low heat, stirring occasionally, for about 5 minutes or until the vegetables have softened but not colored.
8. Add the lentils and stir to coat with the fat. Cover with the water and bring to a boil. Reduce the heat and simmer, partially covered, for about 30 minutes or until the lentils are very tender. Remove the pan from the heat and set aside to cool slightly.
9. Transfer the soup to a blender and puree until smooth. Strain through a
10. or fine-mesh sieve into a small bowl. Season to taste with salt and pepper. Reheat the soup in a small saucepan over medium heat, if necessary.
11. Serve the warm soup in small bowls or demitasse cups and garnish each serving with some of the reserved bacon.
