## Method

1. Spread the curry powder in a dry skillet and toast over low heat, shaking the pan gently, for 40 to 50 seconds or until the curry powder begins to change color.
2. Add the oils to the skillet, raise the heat, and bring to a simmer. Immediately reduce the heat to very low and steep gently for 1 hour.
3. Remove the skillet from the heat and let the oil cool to room temperature. Transfer the oil to a lidded glass container and refrigerate for 2 to 3 days to give the flavors time to blend.
4. Strain the oil through a coffee filter into a clean glass container. Use immediately or cover and refrigerate for up to 2 months.
