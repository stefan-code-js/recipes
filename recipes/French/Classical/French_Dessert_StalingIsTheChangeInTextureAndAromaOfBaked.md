## Method

1. Staling is the change in texture and aroma of baked goods due to the change in structure and the
2. loss of moisture by the starch granules. s tale baked goods have lost their fresh-baked aroma and are
3. firmer, drier, and more crumbly than fresh products.
4. prevention of staling is a major concern of the baker because most baked goods lose
5. 1. Protecting the product from air.Wrapping bread in plastic and covering cakes with icing are two examples.
6. crusts will become soft. these bread products should always be served fresh.
7. 2. Adding moisture retainers to the formula.
8. Fats and sugars are good moisture retainers, and products high in these ingredients keep best.
9. some of the best French bread has no fat at all, and if it is not served within hours of
10. baking, it will begin to stale. For longer keeping, bakers often add a very small amount of fat and/or sugar to the formula.
11. 3. Freezing.baked goods frozen before they become stale maintain quality for longer periods. they should
12. be served very soon after thawing. Frozen breads may be reheated with excellent results if they
13. are served immediately.
14. refrigerating actually speeds staling rather than slowing it. only baked goods that could
15. develop health hazards, such as those with cream fillings, are refrigerated.
16. Loss of crispness is caused by absorption of moisture, so it is, in a sense, the opposite of staling.
17. this is a problem with low-moisture products such as cookies and pie crusts. the problem is usually
18. air. p rebaked pie shells should be filled as close to service time as possible.
19. the following introduction to baking ingredients is necessarily simplified. i f you decide to pursue
20. a career as a baker, you will need to learn a great deal of technical information. however, the basic
21. information presented here is enough to enable you to produce a full range of baked items in a small
22. bakeshop or restaurant kitchen.
23. White Wheat Flour
24. White wheat flour is milled from wheat kernels after the outer covering, called bran , and the germ
25. are removed. Wheat flour normally contains 63 to 73 percent starch and 6 to 15 percent protein. the
26. rest is moisture, fat, sugar, and minerals.
27. • What are seven changes that take place in doughs and batters as they are baked?
28. • how can you slow the rate at which baked goods become stale?
