## Method

1. When I make this, I think of my mom, Gloria, who made delicious cold chickpea salads every summer to take to the picnics and cookouts she so enjoyed. I fondly recall her chickpea and feta cheese salad, and developed this in her memory. I urge you to find a creamy feta cheese with just the right salt content. Most feta is made from sheep’s milk, but it can also be made with goat and cow milk. Some ardently believe the best comes from Greece, but others prefer Bulgarian, Turkish, French, or Italian feta. There’s very good feta made in the United States. It’s not a complex cheese, but when correctly made, it crumbles pleasantly even as it slices. As a departure, you could whip the chickpeas in a food processor, pile the puree on a spoon, and serve it with feta crumbled over it.
2. rib celery, chopped
3. carrot, chopped
4. ½ small onion, chopped
5. ½ cup chopped flat-leaf parsley
6. ½ cup chopped fresh oregano
7. Put the chickpeas in a large bowl and add enough cold water to cover by several inches. Soak the chickpeas for at least 6 hours or overnight. Drain and transfer to a large saucepan or a stockpot.
8. Cut a 10-inch square of cheesecloth and mound the celery, carrot, and onion in the center of the square. Bring the corners of the cloth together and tie the sachet with kitchen string.
9. Add enough cold water to cover the chickpeas by 3 inches. Add the vegetable sachet. Bring to a boil over high heat and boil rapidly for 3 to 5 minutes, skimming any foam that rises to the surface. Reduce the heat and simmer gently for 45 minutes to 1 hour or until the chickpeas are tender and cooked through. Add additional water to the pan as needed to keep the chickpeas covered.
10. Drain the contents of the pan into a colander. Remove and discard the vegetable sachet. Transfer the chickpeas to a large bowl and allow them to cool to room temperature. Cover and refrigerate.
11. Preheat the oven to 300°F.
12. Slice the pointed tops off the garlic heads and brush the exposed pulp with oil so that it is well coated. Wrap the heads securely in aluminum foil and arrange in a small baking pan. Roast for about 1 hour or until the garlic is soft. Allow to cool and then refrigerate if not using immediately.
13. Gently squeeze the bottoms of the garlic heads so that the softened pulp is extracted from the individual cloves. Discard the skins. Put the pulp in a small bowl and mash with a wooden spoon until pureed. While mashing, add enough oil to achieve a saucelike consistency. Season to taste with salt and pepper. Cover and refrigerate until ready to use.
14. Preheat the broiler.
15. Put the bell pepper on a broiling tray and broil for 10 to 15 minutes, turning several times, until the pepper is softened and the skin is charred and blistered. Alternatively, hold the pepper over a gas flame, turning it to char the skin. Put the charred pepper in a small bowl, cover with plastic wrap, and allow to steam for about 10 minutes. Using your fingers, rub the charred skin from the cooled pepper. Cut the flesh into strips and remove and discard the seeds and ribs. Cut the flesh into ½-inch dice.
16. In a large pot of boiling water, cook the couscous for 3 to 5 minutes or until tender. Drain the couscous in a
17. or fine-mesh sieve and transfer to a medium-sized bowl. Use a fork to fluff up the grains. Cover and refrigerate until chilled.
18. Add the couscous to the bowl of chickpeas and toss with the roasted pepper, the parsley, the oregano, and the ¼ cup oil. Season to taste with salt and pepper.
19. To serve, spread a dab of garlic sauce in the bowl of a decorative tablespoon. Top with a mound of chickpea salad-about ¼ cup per serving-and garnish with a sprinkling of feta cheese. Repeat to make 5 more servings.
