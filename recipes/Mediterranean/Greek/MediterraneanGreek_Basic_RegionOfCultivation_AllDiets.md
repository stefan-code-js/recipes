## Method

1. An annual plant, it produces large seed capsules that are harvested as they ripen.
2. The capsules are dried then crushed to release the seeds, which are either sold whole or have their oil extracted.
3. In natural remedies the seeds are used to alleviate cold symptoms, treat digestive ailments, and encourage lactation.
4. T utankhamun’s tomb in ancient Egypt, nigella has been cultivated for its seeds for more than 3,000 years. Its name derives from the Latin nigellus or niger (black). Ancient Greeks and Arabs appreciated the seed’s curative and preservative properties; according to an Arab proverb, nigella is “a remedy for all diseases except death”. An ancient Arab text describes it as habbatul barakah, “seed of blessing”, while in the Old T estament it is called ketzah. The Roman physician and philosopher Galen prescribed nigella seeds to treat colds, and they are still used in this way: a spoonful of seeds is wrapped in muslin, held to the nostril, and inhaled to clear a blocked nose. Nigella has been used as a herbal remedy across southern Europe, western Asia, and the Middle East.Spice story
