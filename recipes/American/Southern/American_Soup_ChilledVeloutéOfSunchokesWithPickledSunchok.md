## Method

1. Credit for this soup goes to Elliot Bowles, one of my former sous-chefs at Tru, who grew up in a military family and lived all over the world. He attributes his love for sunchokes to the years he spent in Hawaii. I had barely heard of them before I met Elliot and was bowled over when I tasted this soup. You will be, too. The sunchokes give it a mild nuttiness, somewhat like water chestnuts. I add the caviar for saltiness and elegance.
2. Sunchokes are also called Jerusalem artichokes and, despite this moniker, are tubers from a native American sunflower and are not related to artichokes. When you buy them, there is no hint of the glorious sunflower, but instead the chokes are beige-colored knobs that resemble fresh ginger. Like potatoes, they darken, or oxidize, when sliced, so keep them in acidulated water while you work. This recipe requires some preparation a day ahead.
3. A day before you plan to serve this, fill a large nonreactive bowl with water and add 1 teaspoon of the lemon juice to make acidulated water.
4. Peel and cut the largest sunchoke into 10 thin slices, dropping the slices into the acidulated water as they are cut. This will prevent them from turning brown.
5. Cut an 8-inch square of cheesecloth and mound the pickling spices in the center of the square. Bring the corners of the cloth together and tie the sachet with kitchen string.
6. Combine the syrup and vinegar in a medium-sized glass or ceramic bowl. Drain the sunchoke slices and add to the bowl along with the spice sachet. Season to taste with salt. Cover and refrigerate for at least 24 hours.
7. Remove and discard the sachet and drain the sunchoke slices before serving.
8. Fill a large nonreactive bowl with water and add the remaining lemon juice to make acidulated water.
9. Peel and coarsely dice the remaining 6 sunchokes, dropping the dice into the acidulated water as they are cut.
10. Combine the cream and vegetable stock in a large saucepan. Drain and add the sunchoke dice. Bring to a boil over medium-high heat, reduce the heat, and simmer for 10 to 15 minutes or until the sunchokes are tender.
11. Transfer the soup to a blender and puree until smooth. You will have to do this in batches. Strain the batches through a
12. or fine-mesh sieve into a large bowl. Stir in more stock until the soup reaches the consistency you prefer. Season to taste with salt and white pepper. Cover and chill.
13. Serve the chilled soup in small bowls or demitasse cups with a slice of pickled sunchoke and a garnish of caviar.
