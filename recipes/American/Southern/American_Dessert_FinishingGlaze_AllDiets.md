## Method

1. mL Cooking Glaze
2. Reduce the glaze gently in a pot on the stove until it can coat the back of a spoon. Reserve warm
3. Cooking Glaze
4. Use gloved hands to pluck the teals of their feathers. Do not pluck the head of the teals, and only pluck the feathers to the elbow joint of the drumettes on the wings -leave the rest of th
5. eathers on the wingettes and wing tips. Gut the tea ls and carefully wash out the interior of the
6. carcass with cold water to remove any residual blood and guts. Try not to get the wings wet asyou do this. Once washed, dry the birds completely, and fill the cavity of the birds with C -fold
7. towels. Allow the teals to rest on their backs on wire racks, uncovered, in the fridge for 3 to 5
8. days to dry out and age. Change the C -fold towels inside the teals twice a day.
9. Well before service, liberally coat all visible skin of the teals in koji cure. Place the birds back into
10. the fridge to cure for 1 hour. Once cured, wipe off the koji cure with dry paper towels until
11. completely cleaned. Use foil to wrap the wings of the birds to prevent the feathers from burning
12. when cooking over the barbecue. Allow the birds to res t out of the fridge until completely
13. Soak the birch bark in water to completely hydrate.
14. To cook the teals, the BBQ needs to be set up with a spot of white- hot glowing coals and a
15. cooler area, no hotter than 50°C, for resting. Directly underneat h the resting spot, place a few
16. pieces of soaked birch bark and light it with hot charcoal to smolder and smoke. Place a tempered bird onto the hot grill on one breast side of the crown. Hold the foil -wrapped wings
17. behind the bird and rock the crown back a nd forth, alternating the cooking of each breast about
18. every 4 or 5 seconds, to cook the breasts and build up caramelization. Be careful not to let the flesh seize up by resting over the high heat for too long. You should always be handling the teal,turni ng it and watching for hot spots and flare -ups. Be patient as you cook, the rendering teal fat
19. will continuously flare up. Have a fresh towel on hand to wipe clean any fat that begins to render out. The teal should taste caramelized, not of burnt fat.
20. After about a minute, turn it over onto its back and allow it to cook from underneath. If the charcoal flares up, transfer the teal to the resting spot to rest, smoke, and carry through.
21. Return the teal to the grill and repeat this process -cooking evenly on all sides to slowly bring
22. o the size of the bird, this will happen very quickly. Once this temperature is reached, begin to
23. apply the cooking glaze. Brush the cooking glaze over the bird until completely covered. As you cook the teal, the glaze should dry in and caramelize, not burn. Continue to cook and glaze the
