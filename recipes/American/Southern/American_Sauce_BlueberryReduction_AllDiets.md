## Method

1. Blend the blueberries in a Thermomix until well puréed. F reeze the mixture in 1 L containers,
2. leaving room in the container for expansion in the freezer. Once frozen, remove the solid bricks
3. from their containers and place them in cheesecloth in a shallow perforated gastro tray ove r a
4. eep gastro tray to catch the drippings. Keep this setup, covered, in the fridge for 2 to 3 days,
5. until completely thawed. Wring out the thawed mass for maximum extraction. Reduce the harvested blueberry juice in a dehydrator set to 60°C until it reaches a sugar content of 80 ºBx.Reserve the reduction, vac uum sealed, in the freezer until needed.
6. to 15 leftover duck carcasses from the BBQ duck serving (if duck carcasses aren’t available, cleaned whole grey ducks can be ordered and used with their breasts removed)
7. Roast the duck carcasses on parchment -lined gastro trays in an oven at 200°C for 10 minutes.
8. Once the bones begin to caramelize, turn the oven down to 170°C and continue cooking for 45minutes, or until the bones are well browned. Transfer the roasted carcass es to a pot and cover
9. them with the light chicken stock. Bring the pot up to a boil on the stove, skimming all the while.
10. Once up to a boil, reduce the stockpot to a simmer and allow it cook for 4 to 5 hours, skimming
11. continuously, until the stock takes on a heavy, dark color. Once cooked, strain the stock first
12. fresh pot. At a steady simmer, reduce the stock by one -third, again skimming any impurities
13. away as they build up. Once reduced, allow the glaze to cool to room temperature before
14. transferring it to appropriately sized containers and reserving it in the fridge until needed.
15. Combine all the ingredients and reserve in a small saucepot.
