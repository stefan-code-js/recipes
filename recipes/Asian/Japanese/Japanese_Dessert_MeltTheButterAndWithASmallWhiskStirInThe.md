## Method

1. Melt the butter and, with a small whisk, stir in the salt to dissolve. Reserve the butter at room
2. temperature for service, stirring it before use. Also be sure the keep the side of the pot clean with a rubber spatula to prevent salt from crystallizing out of the liquid.
3. When plucking the ducks, only pluck the wings down to the elbow joint of the drumstick and nofarther. Remove the wings from the crown by beginning with the back of the bird, between th
4. and purposefully removing about 20 g (a small mouthful) of the top of each duck breast (the outer fat end of the breast) as you do so.
5. The duck wings will be left with all their flesh and feathers on. You will need to remove the rounded portion of bone at the end of the drumette closest to the breast meat. Do so carefully
6. with a sharp knife or butcher’s scissors. Once this piece of bone is removed, use a small, sharp butcher’s knife to clean out the underside of the breast’s silver skin and connective tissues,
7. making sure not to detach the breast from the rest of the wing or leave it hanging too flimsily. Wrap the exposed drumette and the wingette tightly in twine to provide a grip for guests to pickup the serving. Place a small sq uare of parchment on either side of the exposed breast meat and
8. reserve the prepared duck wings in the fridge.
9. Roasted Kelp Butter
10. Preheat a rondeau full of grapeseed oil to 180°C. Take the cleaned wing and dust the exposed
11. breast meat with rice flour. From there dip it into the sourdough batter. Place the wing in the hot oil, holding the feathered portion up and out of the fryer. Be careful not to dip the twine
12. wrapped around the drumette in the tempura batter or the hot oil.
13. Fry the wings for roughly 1 minute 30 seconds, or until medium inside. Once cooked, remove the wing from the fryer and allow it to res t on C -fold towels for about 1 minute. Brush on a bit of
14. the roasted kelp butter. Season the wing well, all over, with salt and the arctic kelp salt, horseradish juice, and pine vinegar. Serve immediately.
