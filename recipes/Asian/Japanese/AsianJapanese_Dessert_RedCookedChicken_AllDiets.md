## Method

1. short. Once the mise en place is done, stir-fried dishes can be sent to the table in a matter of minutes.
2. Although stir-frying is an important technique in China, many
3. other cooking techniques are also used, especially simmering and steaming. Two of the recipes in this section, Tea-Smoked Duck and Red-Cooked Chicken, are typical examples of steaming and
4. simmering.Although both these recipes begin with whole poultry, the birds
5. are cut into small pieces before they are served. In a typical Chinese meal, meats, fish, and vegetables are not so much main dishes as they
6. are accompaniments to rice or, sometimes, noodles. Portion sizes of
7. protein items are small, and the dishes are served family-style in the center of the table. Each diner takes a small quantity of the desired dishes to eat between bites of rice.
8. no single cooking style. The styles of Beijing in the north, Guangdong (Canton) in the southeast, and Sichuan (Szechwan) in the interior, are perhaps as different as the styles of Germany, France, and Italy.
