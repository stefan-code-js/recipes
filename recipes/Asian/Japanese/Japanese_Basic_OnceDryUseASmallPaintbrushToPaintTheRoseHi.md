## Method

1. brush, fill in these cracks with a bit more of the rose hip and berry leather base for the back of the ladybug. We do not want to brush in an additional layer of leather (or the leather will become too thick), just enough to fill in any cracks. Leave this leather to dry at room temperature or in an oven at 60°C. Once dried and still warm, carefully remove the ladybug
2. from the mold. Transfer to a parchment -lined 1 L container and continue to dry in a dehydrator
3. set to 60°C until dry and crispy.
4. Set a pan on an induction cooktop, preheat on setting 5, add the oil, and sear the strawberries
5. facedown until well caramelized and almost burnt. Flip the berries and continue to cook until the other side has caramelized as much as the first. Once equally caramelized, use a rubber spatula to remove the sautéed strawberries from the pan. Pass the mixture through a fine tamislined with a fine -mesh nylon sieve and allow it to cool. Transfer the passed paste to piping bags
6. for service. Re serve in the fridge.
7. In a medium rondeau on the stove, melt the butter over medium heat and then add the Japanese quince. Simmer the fruit with the dried carrot flower for approximately 1 hour, or unt
8. he quince becomes tender. Once cooked, allow the mixture to cool, then pound it with a
9. mortar and pestle before passing it through a tamis lined with a fine -mesh nylon sieve. Reserv e
10. he paste in the fridge until needed. Due to the butter in the recipe, the quince paste needs to
11. be tempered and held at room temperature for service.
