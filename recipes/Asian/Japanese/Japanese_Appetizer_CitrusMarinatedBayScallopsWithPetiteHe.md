## Method

1. Scallops harvested in American waters are shucked soon after they are caught, which is why it’s unusual to find them in their pretty scalloped shells. Select pale-pinkish or -orangey bay scallops; if you’re buying sea scallops, they should be creamy white or tinged with pink. No scallops should be bright white, which indicates they were soaked in a solution to extend their shelf life. (While this is not dangerous, it causes the mollusks to absorb water, which they will expel when marinated or cooked.) For this recipe, seek out the recommended bay scallops and marinate them on the day you buy them if at all possible.
2. In a small bowl, whisk the olive oil with the lemon, orange, and lime juices.
3. Slice the scallops thinly and put in a small nonreactive bowl. Spoon half of the citrus dressing over the scallops and toss to mix.
4. Put the frisée and chervil in another small bowl and toss with as much of the remaining dressing as needed to coat the greens. Season to taste with salt and pepper.
5. To serve, drain the scallops. Put equal portions of the scallops onto 6 small plates. Season to taste with salt. Place a small amount of the salad alongside the scallops.
