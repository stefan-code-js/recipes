## Method

1. Blend the black pears in the Thermomix to purée them. Reduce the black pear purée in a 1 L
2. container in a dehydrator set to 60°C until it reduces in weight by one -third. Once reduced,
3. reserve, covered, in the fridge.
4. Blend the black pears in the Thermomix to purée them. Transfer the blended pears to 1 L containers, being sure to leave a bit of space between the rim of the container and the purée toallow for expansion while freezing. Place a lid on the container and freeze the black pear purée.Once frozen, remove the blocks, and hang them in a cheesecloth -lined perforated gastro
5. situated above another gastro container. Place this setup in the fridge and leave for the frozen blocks to defrost and the black pear juice to drain into the bottom gastro. Once fully defrosted,compost any resulting pulp. Transfer the strained juice to a pot and bring it up to a light simmer,then transfer it to a 1 L container and place this in a dehydrator set to 60°C. Reduce the black
6. pear juice till it has a sugar content of 74 ºBx. Once reduced, vacuum seal and freeze to preventoxidation.
7. In the Thermomix, blend all the ingredients except the charcoal powder together on high speed.
8. The resulting purée should be very black. If it is not, add a teaspoon or t wo of the charcoal
9. powder, but only if necessary. Blend again and then pass the mixture through a tamis lined with
10. a fine -mesh nylon sieve. Once passed, spread the purée onto a silpat lined with silpat cutouts of
11. the stag beetle segments. Additionally, spread a sheet of the purée onto a silpat lined with
12. another silpat with multiple 5.3 cm round cutouts in it. Remove the silpat stencil and dry both
13. silpat s of formed leather overnight at room temperature. Dry them enough to peel them off and
14. handle, but ensu re they are still soft enough to melt in your mouth and not stick in your teeth.
