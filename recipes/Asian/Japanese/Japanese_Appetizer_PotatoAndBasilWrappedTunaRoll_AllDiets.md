## Method

1. This amuse, so fun and contemporary, is also a great hors d’oeuvre, delicious if dipped in a little soy sauce mixed with wasabi or with an aioli. I like to pass the sliced logs on a mirrored tray for a spectacular presentation. As an amuse, I serve it with drizzles of pesto oil.
2. You will need a mandolin or potato-slicing wheel to cut the potato into very thin strips that can be wrapped around the tuna without cracking. The quick frying crisps the potato but leaves the tuna raw-for “potato sushi,” rather than rice sushi-and conveys sensual experiences of hot and cold, brittle and tender. Use top-grade yellow fin or blue fin tuna, which is so fresh, it’s called sushi quality. Once you wrap the tuna in the sliced potatoes, don’t wait to deep-fry them, or the potatoes will brown and dry out.
3. Microgreens or fresh sprigs chervil, for garnishing
4. Cut the tuna into 2 logs, making them as squared and even as possible. Each should be about 1 inch thick. Brush with the olive oil and season to taste with salt and pepper.
5. Wrap the tuna logs with the basil leaves, pressing the leaves into the sides of the fish so that they cling to the oil. Position them so that they enclose the tuna logs, with just the ends exposed.
6. Using a Japanese mandolin or a turning vegetable slicer, slice the potatoes into long, thin strips. Drop the strips into water to prevent them from browning.
7. Wrap the longest strips around the tuna logs to cover the basil leaves. Let the strips overlap slightly.
8. Pour vegetable oil into a deep, heavy saucepan to a depth of 3 inches, or enough oil to cover each log completely when it is lowered into it. Heat over high heat until a deep-frying thermometer registers 425°F.
9. Using tongs, gently and carefully submerge one of the logs in the hot oil and fry for about 10 seconds or until the potatoes are golden brown. Lift from the oil with the tongs, taking care not to crack the coating. Set aside on paper towels to cool. Repeat with the other log.
10. To serve, season the logs with more salt and pepper, and slice into twelve ¼-inch slices. Put 2 pieces on each of 6 small plates and drizzle with a little pesto oil. Sprinkle the rolls lightly with sesame seeds and garnish with a few sprigs of microgreens.
