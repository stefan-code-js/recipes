## Method

1. Nobu, the Japanese restaurant in New York City’s TriBeCa, is one of my favorite haunts, run by one of my favorite chefs. After eating fluke there one evening, I was inspired to develop this dish. Chef Nobu Matsuhisa does a hot sashimi presentation at the table by pouring boiling seasoned oil over fresh, raw fish. This flash-cooks the fish as it adds seasoning.
2. The radish salad is an outgrowth of my own curiosity. When I see two, three, or more varieties of a vegetable or fruit in the market, I buy them all and play around with them. Here, the different radishes add color, interest, and depth of flavor. The yuzu provides citrus zing, so integral to my cooking. You will find as you read through my recipes that I use citrus as a seasoning much like other chefs use salt and pepper. I keep a bowl filled with lemons, limes, oranges, and yuzu nearby at all times. Yuzu is a knobby, seed-filled Asian citrus fruit with an intense flavor somewhere between lemon and lime, but one that is still all its own. Try it; you’ll love it as much as I do.
3. tablespoon finely snipped chives, for garnishing
4. Clean the fillet of any remaining skin and bones. Slice the fish on the bias into 6 paper-thin slices and set aside.
5. Using a Japanese mandolin or a sharp knife, slice the radishes into paper-thin slices. Put the slices in a small bowl and toss with the vinegar and 1½ teaspoons of the oil. Season to taste with salt and pepper.
6. To serve, mound equal portions of the radish salad onto 6 small plates. Top each salad with a slice of fluke and, using a small pastry brush, lightly coat the fish with the remaining 1½ teaspoons olive oil and then the
7. . Garnish each serving with a sprinkling of lime zest and chives.
