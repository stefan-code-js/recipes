## Method

1. I love this easy amuse because losbter is always a crowd pleaser. This has Asian flair and it’s not difficult to find rice paper wrappers. When you fill them with firm lobster meat mixed with crunchy cucumber and sweet mango, a simple spring roll transforms into a luxurious dish. The apricot vinaigrette is the perfect accent for this. You need only a little lobster, but even a little makes any dish special.

3. Remove the lobster meat from the shell in one piece and cut the meat lengthwise into quarters. Trim each piece so that it is about 4 inches long. Pull out the digestive tract if it’s present.
4. Remove the seeds from the cucumber with a small spoon or the small end of a melon baller. Discard the seeds. Cut 4 strips from the cucumber, each one about ⅓ inch thick and 4 inches long, so that they match the lobster strips. Make the strips as even as possible. Save any extra cucumber for another use.
5. Peel the skin from the mango with a vegetable peeler for easy removal. Slice the flesh to the pit, squaring it as much as you can. Cut 4 strips from the mango to match the cucumber strips. Make the strips as even as possible. Save any extra mango flesh for another use.
6. Fill a large, shallow bowl with warm water and spread a lint-free dish towel on a work surface.
7. One at a time, drop the rice paper sheets into the water until all are submerged. Soak for 3 minutes or until they are completely softened and pliable. Lift the sheets out of the water with your hands and spread them out on the dish towel to drain, making sure they don’t overlap.
8. Working with 1 wrapper at a time, arrange a strip each of lobster, cucumber, and mango across the bottom third of the wrapper. Season to taste with salt and pepper. Fold the wrapper over the filling and roll into a tight cylinder up to the halfway mark. Fold in the two sides and continue to roll until sealed. Place the roll on a flat plate, seam side down. Repeat to make 3 more rolls. Allow to rest for a few minutes to seal completely.
9. To serve, cut the rolls on the bias into thirds. Spoon some vinaigrette on a small plate and set a slice on top of the sauce, cut side down. Or, slice the spring rolls into smaller pieces and serve on small plates with small ramekins of vinaigrette for dipping.
10. cups coarsely chopped dried apricots
11. Put the apricots in a small bowl and pour hot water over them. Let them soften for about 30 minutes. Drain and discard the soaking liquid.
12. In a blender, combine the drained apricots, vinegar, and simple syrup and pulse to make a coarse puree.
13. With the motor running, slowly add as much of the water as necessary for a fluid, smooth consistency. Season to taste with salt. Strain through a
14. or fine-mesh sieve set over a small bowl. Transfer to a nonreactive covered container and refrigerate until needed. The vinaigrette will keep for up to 4 days.
