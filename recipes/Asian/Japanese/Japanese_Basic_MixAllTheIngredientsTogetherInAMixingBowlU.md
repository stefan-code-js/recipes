## Method

1. Mix all the ingredients together in a mixing bowl until well emulsified, then reserve in the fridge
2. until needed, but keep the butter warm and melted for service.
3. Use thick, deep -red-colored stalks of rhubarb, ensuring there aren’t green parts to the portion.
4. Peel the stalk on the rhubarb with a turning knif e to remove the coarse outer strands. Slice the
5. rhubarb on a mandolin at 0.5 mm. Take the slices to a vacuum bag and marinate them in peppe
6. amari (using enough to coat the slices liberally) and seal them on maximum to compress them.
7. Do this first thing in the morning so that they can sit for at least 6 to 7 hours.
8. After the slices have cured, remove them from the bag. Place the rhubarb slices in a tamis andgrill them over medium -low heat on a coal -fired barbecue. Brush them with the melted grilling
9. butter. Flip them during the process to cook them to the point of light caramelization, ensuring
10. they’ve become tender upon biting into them. The butter should be foaming on the rhubarb bythe time they’re done cooking on the grill. Remove the slices of rhuba rb from the grill and roll
11. them over themselves in loose curls. Place the picked angelica buds over the top (about 1 crown
12. per portion) and season the rhubarb curls with spruce wood oil and salt.
13. Pick out the nicest seaweed leaves, ones measuring 5 to 6 cm in length. Wash them of any sandin cold -infused dashi. Once clean, lay them out flat on a Silpat -lined tray, and leave them to dry
14. at room temperatu re until they’re dry to the touch. Get fresh cold -infused dashi and reduce it
15. until thick in a nonstick pan on the stove. Once reduced, remove it from the heat and allow it to
16. cool. Brush one side of the seaweed with the dashi and leave it to dry again at room temperature. Once dry to the touch, transfer them to a dehydrator set to 50°C to hold until needed in service. Use one leaf per person.
