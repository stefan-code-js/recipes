## Method

1. Preheat the oven to 350°F (see
2. ). Line a baking sheet with a silicone baking mat or parchment paper. Have ready an identical baking sheet and another silicone mat or piece of parchment.
3. Peel the potato. Use a Japanese mandolin or a very sharp knife to cut the potato lengthwise into paper-thin slices.
4. Choose 6 of the largest slices that are most similar in shape. With a sharp paring knife, make 3 small slits in a row in the center of each slice, so that an anchovy can be threaded through along the length.
5. Thread an anchovy fillet through the slits of one slice. Repeat with the remaining anchovies and potato slices. Brush both sides of the chips with olive oil and season to taste with salt and pepper.
6. Arrange the slices on the prepared baking sheet and cover with the second silicone mat or piece of parchment. Top with the second baking sheet and put the sandwiched assembly in the oven. Bake for 10 to 15 minutes or until the chips are golden brown.
7. To serve, season the hot chips with salt and pepper and place each chip on a small plate.
