## Method

1. fold it in half widthwise. Cut down the sugar kelp blade into manageable lengths and lay it intoone half of the parchment, so that each strip of the blade is just overlapping. Being careful notto move the kelp around, fold the other half of the parchment paper over the seaweed, and place the whole package into a large vacuum bag. Place the bag into a vac machine between risers to keep the setup flat and compressed and seal it on maximum. Transfer the seaweed to awater bath equipped with an immersion circulator set to 90°C and cook it for 30 seconds. Remove the kelp from the bath and let it cool to room temperature -do not shock the seaweed.
2. Open the bag and remove the kelp sheet. Using a deformed ring cutter that has been squashedinto an ellipse measuring 10.5 cm x 9.5 cm, punch out rounds from the sheet of kelp, being sureto orient the ring cutter’s long end to touch both frilled edges of each strip of sugar kelp (as thefrilled edges will shrink more than the thick center once cooked). Reserve the punched -out
3. pieces of kelp in a container in the fridge until needed.

5. Place all the ingredients into a spice grinder and blend into a fine powder. Reserve until needed.
