## Method

1. Pour the vegetable oil into a deep, heavy saucepan to a depth of 2 inches. Heat over high heat until a deep-frying thermometer registers 350°F.
2. Meanwhile, use a Japanese mandolin to cut the potato crosswise into 18 very thin slices. If you don’t have a mandolin, use a small sharp knife to cut very thin slices.
3. Gently pat the potato slices with paper towels. Drop the slices into the hot oil and fry for 1 to 2 minutes or until golden brown. Remove from the oil with a slotted spoon or spider and drain on a double thickness of paper towels. Sprinkle with salt while still hot. Transfer the chips to a wire rack to cool.
4. To serve, place a small dollop of the crème fraîche mixture on 3 of the chips. Stack the chips, with the crème fraîche facing up, on a small plate. Top with caviar. Repeat to make 5 more servings.
