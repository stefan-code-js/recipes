## Method

1. g Mushroom Spice Mix
2. Melt the butter in a pan and add the mushroom spice mix. Cook the spice mix in the butter for 5minutes at a low temperature. Remove it and cool it in a metal bowl over an ice bath, whisking
3. periodically to get the butter to set homogeneously. Reserve in an airtight container in the
4. Saw the head in half between where the antlers would be and carefully remove the two lobes ofthe brain. Place the lobes into the brine and let them to rest overnight (8 to 12 hours). Once brined, remove the brains and let them dry on a paper towel. Once drained, place the brains
5. into a parchment -lined 1 L container over another container of ice. In a deep gastro, light a
6. metal container of hay or fire with a torch or glowing coal and snuff it. Place a perforated gastroover the top, place the brains in the gastro, and smoke them twice (covering the gastro setup
7. with a lid and plastic wrap if necessary). Turn the brains over between rounds of smoking to ensure that they’re evenly smoked. Remove them from the smoker and set them aside.
8. Bring a pot of cold- infused dashi to a simmer on the stove (approximately 85°C). Poach the
9. brains in the dashi for 5 to 6 minutes, until firm but not overcooked. They should still be soft andtender, without losing their shape or running out if they’re sliced into. Once poached, allow thebrains to rest at room temperature for 5 minutes. Portion the brains into 5 to 6 mm thick slices.
10. In a hot nonstick pan, melt a spoonful of the mushroom butter. Let it foam briefly, then reduce
11. the heat and add the slices of brain. The aim isn’t to cook them further, but rather to glaze them
12. while turning them, coating them briefly in the butter for 10 seconds. Once glazed, season the slices of brain with salt. Portion the reindeer brain into bite -size pieces, grouped into 18 g
13. portions. Reserve the portions in small squares for service.
