## Method

1. I think of fiddleheads as the platypus of the vegetable kingdom: odd and wonderful. Regardless of where you live along the East Coast, fiddlehead ferns have a very short season. In northern regions, they are available for about two weeks in June, while in more southern reaches, their brief season falls in April. Fiddleheads are furled ferns, wound into bright green coils that resemble the spiraled end of a fiddle, with a fresh flavor that, like that of asparagus and peas, announces that spring has indeed arrived. Nearly all recipes call for cooking the fiddleheads, and while this one is no exception, I like to crunch on raw ones while I work in the kitchen.
2. Here, I pair paper-thin slices of peppery radish with the fiddleheads and serve the ferns as a small, tempting salad-nothing is prettier or fresher-looking after a long winter than these bright-green charmers. If home cooks try them at all, they usually blanch fiddleheads and serve them with butter. Were I to do this, I would also mince some shallot or scallion to toss with them.
3. Bachelor’s button flowers, for garnishing
4. Cut off the base from each fiddlehead if dry and brown. Rinse each fern well, rubbing off any brown chaff from the sides.
5. In a large pot of lightly salted boiling water, blanch the fiddleheads for 5 to 7 minutes or until just tender. Drain and immediately submerge in cold water. Drain again.
6. Remove the thick stem end of each fiddlehead and reserve. Put the coiled tops in a medium-sized bowl and set aside.
7. Puree the reserved fiddlehead stem ends in a food processor or blender. With the motor running, add as much water as needed for a saucelike consistency. Add the oil and process until emulsified. For a thicker sauce, add another tablespoon or so of oil. Transfer to a small bowl.
8. Using a Japanese mandolin or a very sharp knife, cut the radishes into paper-thin slices and add to the bowl of fiddlehead tops. Add enough olive oil to lightly coat the salad. Season to taste with pepper, lemon juice, and Fleur de Sel.
9. To serve, place some of the salad on a small plate along with the sauce. Garnish with bachelor’s buttons. Repeat to make 5 more servings.
