## Method

1. Heat a nonstick pan on number 3, add the clarified butter and heat until bubbling
2. (approximately 100°C). The bee larvae should sizzle when added to the pan. Make sure that there is enough clarified butter to keep the bee larvae half submerged while cooking. Initially, do not mov e the bee larvae. Swirl the pan if necessary, but don’t touch the bee larvae. It will be
3. visibly soft in texture but will eventually regain its shape. Once it does, continuously swirl the larvae in the pan until evenly caramelized. Strain the bee larvae th rough a sieve, reserving the
4. clarified butter for future use. Lay the roasted larvae out on a C -fold towel- lined tray and season
5. with salt. Using tweezers, remove any pieces of larvae that are entirely too dark. Transfer to adehydrator set to 60°C to dry, changing the C -folds regularly.
6. In a mortar, pound the bee pollen with the pestle until it forms a paste. Muddle the elderfloweroil with the pollen until homogeneous. Transfer the mixture to a container and allow it to settleovernight. After the mixture settles, we are just going to use the resulting oil, not the sediment.This should be done twice a week.

Just before service, but after 2 hours of resting in the fridge, transfer the plums to the freezer for 30 minutes -to ensure ease of slicing. Remove the plum from the freezer and slice -if the plum is
9. nice and symmetrical all the way around, then you will be able to get 4 slices from the plum. Ifthe dried plum is n ot so symmetrical and a bit rough looking, you will probably only get two
10. slices from the plum. Each slice should be approximately 1 cm wide.
11. Each portion is 2 slices. After slicing, leave the plum portions out to come to room temperaturebefore serving. Separately, add 1 teaspoon of the elderflower- pollen oil to the serving bowl.
12. Season the oil with 10 drops of cherry vinegar. Brush the plum slices with a bit of the
