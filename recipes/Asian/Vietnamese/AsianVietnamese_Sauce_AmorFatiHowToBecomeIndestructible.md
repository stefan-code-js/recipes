## Method

1. And now, reader, time to part again.
2. I am in Amioun, the village of my ancestors. Sixteen out of sixteen great-great-grandparents, eight out of eight great-grandparents, and four out of four grandparents are buried in the area, almost all within a four-mile radius. Not counting the great-uncles, cousins, and other relatives. They are all resting in cemeteries in the middle of groves of olive trees in the Koura valley at the base of Mount Lebanon, which rises so dramatically that you can see the snow above you only twenty miles away.
3. Today, at dusk, I went to St. Sergius, locally called Mar Sarkis, from the Aramaic, the cemetery of my side of the family, to say hello to my father and my uncle Dédé, who so much disliked my sloppy dressing during my rioting days. I am sure Dédé is still offended with me; the last time he saw me in Paris he calmly dropped that I was dressed like an Australian: so the real reason for my visit to the cemetery was more self-serving. I wanted to prepare myself for where I will go next.
4. This is my plan B. I kept looking at the position of my own grave. A Black Swan cannot so easily destroy a man who has an idea of his final destination.
5. I am carrying Seneca on all my travels, in the original, as I relearned Latin-reading him in English, that language desecrated by economists and the bureaucrats of the Federal Reserve Bank of the United States, did not feel right. Not on this occasion. It would be equivalent to reading Yeats in Swahili.
6. , an untranslatable expression depicting a life of supreme moral qualities, as perceived by the Romans. But, even apart from this unreachable aim, he has practical advice, perhaps the only advice I can see transfer from words to practice. Seneca is the one who (with some help from Cicero) taught Montaigne that
7. . Seneca is the one who taught Nietzsche the
8. , “love fate,” which prompted Nietzsche to just shrug and ignore adversity, mistreatment by his critics, and his disease, to the point of being bored by them.
9. Seneca’s credibility as a moral philosopher (to me) came from the fact that, unlike other philosophers, he did not denigrate the value of wealth, ownership, and property because he was poor. Seneca was said to be one of the wealthiest men of his day. He just made himself ready to lose everything every day. Every day. Although his detractors claim that in real life he was not the Stoic sage he claimed to be, mainly on account of his habit of seducing married women (with non-Stoic husbands), he came quite close to it. A powerful man, he just had many detractors-and, if he fell short of his Stoic ideal, he came much closer to it than his contemporaries. And, just as it is harder to have good qualities when one is rich than when one is poor, it is harder to be a Stoic when one is wealthy, powerful, and respected than when one is destitute, miserable, and lonely.
10. In Seneca’s Epistle IX, Stilbo’s country was captured by Demetrius, called the Sacker of Cities. Stilbo’s children and his wife were killed. Stilbo was asked what his losses were.
11. , I have lost nothing, he answered.
12. My goods are all with me. The man had reached the Stoic self-sufficiency, the robustness to adverse events, called
13. in Stoic jargon. In other words,
14. Which includes one’s own life. Seneca’s readiness to lose everything extended to his own life. Suspected of partaking in a conspiracy, he was asked by the emperor Nero to commit suicide. The record says that he executed his own suicide in an exemplary way, unperturbed, as if he had prepared for it every day.
15. , often mistranslated as “farewell.” It has the same root as “value” and “valor” and means both “be strong (i.e., robust)” and “be worthy.”
