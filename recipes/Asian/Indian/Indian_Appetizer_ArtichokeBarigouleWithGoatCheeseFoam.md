## Method

1. Fill a large glass, ceramic, or other nonreactive bowl with water and add the lemon juice. Drop the artichoke hearts into the water.

3. Drain the artichokes and add them to the pan along with the salt. Pour in as much of the wine as needed to cover the artichokes completely. Bring to a boil over medium-high heat. Reduce the heat and simmer for 30 to 40 minutes or until the artichokes are tender. Remove the artichoke hearts from the pan and allow them to cool on a plate. When cool, slice into sections about 1¼ inches thick. Refrigerate until cold.
4. Put the goat cheese in a small bowl and mash gently with the back of a fork or spoon. Slowly mix in the cream. When the cheese is smooth and the cream completely incorporated, season to taste with salt and pepper.
5. or fine-mesh sieve into another bowl and then pour into the chilled canister of a foamer. The amount will fill it about halfway. Charge with 1 or 2 charges. Chill for at least 1 hour before serving.
6. To serve, arrange some artichoke sections on a small plate. Shake the foamer vigorously and place a little of the goat cheese foam on top. Repeat to make 5 more servings. Serve chilled.
