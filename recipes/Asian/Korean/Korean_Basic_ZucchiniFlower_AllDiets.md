## Method

1. Mix the ingredients together in the Thermomix until blended. Reserve in the fridge until needed.
2. In the Thermomix, combine the koji and the water and blend it into a rough paste (30 seconds
3. should be enough time on high speed). From there, transfer the paste to a container, and placethe peeled Jerusalem artichokes in, ensuring they’re submerged under the paste. Weigh them down with a sheet of plastic wrap if needed. Place them into a chamber held at 60°C for 24
4. hours. Afterward, remove the Jerusalem artichokes from their koji bath and clean them lightly of
5. any pulp. Allow the artichokes to cool and weigh them. Calculate 12% of that weight in sea
6. buckthorn kimchi paste, then marinate the Jerus alem artichokes in it. From there, transfer
7. everything to vacuum bags, vacuum seal the marinated artichokes on maximum, and transfer them to the fridge to age until needed.
8. Slice the base off the bottom of the flower and remove the stigma and stamen of the flower.
9. Separate the individual flower petals if it’s a large flower or keep 2 petals together if it’s smaller.
10. Brush a sheet of parchment paper liberally with koji oil and place the flower petals flat onto the
11. paper. Fold the parchment over to sandwich the petals and then vacuum seal the bag shut between two risers or in the vacuum machine at maximum power to seal them flat. Set a combioven to 100°C (100% fan) steam and pl ace the bag of flowers in for 5 minutes. Once cooked,
12. shock the bag in ice water and then cut the bag open carefully to peel the flower petals off. Transfer the flower petals to a mesh dehydrator mat and top them with another mesh dehydrator mat to sandwic h them shut. Place them into a dehydrator set to 60°C for 10 to 12
13. hours, until the flowers are completely crisp. VERY carefully remove the flowers from the mat
14. and store them between parchment in an airtight container with silica discs to keep them crisp.
