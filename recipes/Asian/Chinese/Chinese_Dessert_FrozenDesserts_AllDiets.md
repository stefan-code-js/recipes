## Method

1. To understand recipes for ice creams and sorbets, you need to appreciate the concept of the ratio of dry to wet ingredients. Dry ingredients include everything that is suspended in the water in the ice cream (also called the “ice cream mix”): sugar, fruit purée, chocolate, and milk fat and proteins. Generally speaking, an ice cream mix is approximately 56-70% water (from the milk and cream and that contained
2. in fruit) and 30-44% solids (“dry” ingredients). The ice cream’s texture and structure depend on the dry

4. ating the ideal ice cream texture. In addition to regular sugar (sucrose), the most common are:- glucose powder: since it inhibits sucrose crystallization, it makes for smoother ice cream. If too much is used, the ice cream becomes rubbery. It has a lower sweetness value than sucrose;- dextrose: a glucose extract with a higher sweetness value than glucose powder but lower than sucrose.
5. It makes ice cream smoother by lowering the freezing point;- invert sugar: its sweetness value is notably higher than sucrose. Like the others, it makes ice cream smoother, but should be used only for ice creams that are naturally harder because of their high fat con -
6. tent (chocolate, praline, pistachio). It is not recommended for sorbets made with acidic fruits (red fruits, citrus) since it inhibits their preservation. It can be replaced with honey-a natural invert sugar-but this will affect the flavor. In the home kitchen, these sugars can all be replaced by sucrose (ordinary sugar) in the same measure. The resulting ice cream will be slightly sweeter.
7. Fat is added to ice cream in the form of egg yolks and milk products: butter, cream, whole milk. It is important to use whole milk and to choose good-quality products for the mix, because the structure and smoothness of the end product depend on it. Fat hardens during freezing, which contributes to the texture and mouthfeel.
8. Powdered milk is a dried, defatted milk extract: it increases the percentage of dry ingredients in the mix, which stabilizes it by absorbing part of the water contained in the mix, in turn limiting the unpleasant gritty texture on the palate. Always be sure to use skim milk powder, which contains no fat. You can have too much of a good thing: an excess tends to make ice cream sandy. Measure carefully!
9. Ice cream and sorbet mixes made according to professional recipes often use additives to stabilize water and emulsify fat. They help:- make smoother ice creams;- improve texture by eliminating the formation of crystals;- slow down melting when serving;- improve storage properties.a brief history
