## Method

1. the Han Dynasty, it was reportedly mixed into plaster to perfume the walls of “pepper houses” - buildings that housed the Emperor’s concubines - to warm the rooms and perfume the air. It has also been found in tombs in northern China dating back to a similar period. The pepper was used to spice luxury foods and wines; Hanshan, an 8th century Chinese poet, described lavish dishes of “roast duck tinctured with Sichuan pepper and salt”. It was also key in foods prepared as offerings to the gods. Perhaps because the plant bears many fruits and seeds, it was adopted as a fertility symbol, and in some rural areas of China today the spice is still thrown over newlyweds, like rice or confetti.
