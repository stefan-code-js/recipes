4. with the cinnamon and ginger.Iran’s spice palette and cuisine are as rich and exciting
5. as its history. In this sprawling intersection between east and west - the centre of the Persian Empire and the Silk Road, invaded by Greeks, Arabs, T urks, Mongols, and Uzbeks - you’ll find caviar and Chinese noodles, smoked fish and hot-and-sour prawns, and a natural larder brimming with pistachios, pomegranates, mint, walnuts, and the prized Iranian saffron, grown in the northeast. Stews and pilafs are underpinned by Iran’s sweet-and-sour spices - sumac, dried limes, barberries, and tamarind - while fragrant rose petals give spice mixes and sweets a hint of the exotic.IRAN
