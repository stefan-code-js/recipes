## Ingredients

- late 1920s , the Metropolitan Life Insurance Company (MetLife) was in the process of building the tallest building in the world. Then the stock market crashed, the money dried up, and MetLife was left with an unfinished (yet impossibly grand) tower standing at only one-third of its intended height. It’s a marvelous space: thirty-foot windows overlooking Madison Avenue and the park across the street, revolving doors of nickel, soaring ceilings, gorgeous inlays of marble and limestone-it’s a landmark of art deco, a truly breathtaking building.
