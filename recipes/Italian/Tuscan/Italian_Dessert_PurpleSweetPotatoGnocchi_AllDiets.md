## Method

1. PURPLE SWEET POTATO GNOCCHI This recipe will work with any sweet potato, but if you buy purple-fleshed sweet potatoes, your gnocchi will be this spectacularly regal shade. Look for a grower called Frieda’s and a variety called Stokes Purple. You can see where their potatoes are available by state by looking at the store locator on www.friedas.com, or you can order them online. Aside from the deep, vibrant color, the texture is drier than most sweet potatoes, which makes for perfect gnocchi textu
