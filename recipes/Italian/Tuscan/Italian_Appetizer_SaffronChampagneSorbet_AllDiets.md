## Method

1. As soon as I thought of it, I loved the idea of serving a Champagne amuse. Champagne is a celebratory wine-why not experience it in an amuse at the beginning of a special meal? But plain Champagne was not enough. At Tru, my chef de cuisine, Mark Andelbradt, suggested adding saffron to the Champagne for a twist and it worked wonderfully. The result was this light, refreshing, and very elegant amuse. Serve it in an orange cone.
2. I love using saffron, which arguably used to be the most precious of all spices. As long ago as the Middle Ages, it was a status symbol in Europe, where it was often used to coat cooked food for a showy presentation. For centuries, Abruzzi, Italy, was one of the most famous saffron-producing regions, and Abruzzi saffron was long regarded as the best there was. Today, saffron is used less frequently in cooking, although some dishes, such as Spanish paella and risotto Milanese, rely on it. Saffron is the dried stigmas of crocuses, which bloom for only a few weeks. Because the stigmas are extracted by hand, it is very costly. For the best flavor, buy saffron from a reputable dealer.
3. Stir the Champagne and saffron together in a medium-sized saucepan and bring to a boil over high heat. Reduce the heat and simmer for 15 to 20 minutes or until reduced by half. Remove from the heat, stir in the verjus, and set aside to cool.
4. When cool, whisk in the syrup. Add the lemon juice and salt to taste.
5. If using a conventional ice-cream machine, transfer the mixture to a pitcher, cover, and refrigerate for at least 2 hours or until thoroughly chilled. Freeze in the ice-cream machine according to the manufacturer’s directions. Put the frozen sorbet in a chilled container, press plastic wrap against the surface, and cover. Freeze until ready to serve.
6. If using a PacoJet, pour the mixture into a PacoJet canister and freeze completely. Place the canister in the machine and spin, according to the manufacturer’s directions.
7. To serve, scoop 1-tablespoon mounds of sorbet into orange
