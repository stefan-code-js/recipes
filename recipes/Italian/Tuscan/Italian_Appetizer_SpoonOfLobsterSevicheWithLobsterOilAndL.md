## Method

1. Norman Van Aken, chef-owner of Norman’s Restaurant, has always been a great friend and inspiration in the kitchen, but as much as I admire the cooking of Miami’s acclaimed chef, I am not what you’d call a nuevo Latino guy. Nevertheless, this seviche is a tribute to many that Norman makes, while still being typical of the food I serve at Tru.
2. You can make this amuse with any fish, but I use lobster because it’s so elegant and flavorful. The acid in the marinade sets the palate salivating with anticipation-all you need is a little bite. The delicate lobster can be served on a spoon or a fork, or in lobster -tail shells. Toss the lobster meat with clams and serve on clam shells.
3. pound cooked lobster meat, from the tails of three 1-pound lobsters (see Notes
4. tablespoon finely chopped fresh cilantro
5. , for garnishing
6. Six 2-inch-long chive pieces, for garnishing
7. Remove the ribs and seeds from the peppers. Mince very fine. Mince the red onion very fine. Chop the lobster meat very fine. Toss the peppers, onion, and lobster together in a glass or ceramic bowl.
8. Add the mirin, oil, and citrus juices to the lobster mixture. Toss gently. Add the cilantro and toss gently. Season with salt and pepper and refrigerate for no more than 30 minutes.
9. To serve, scoop the lobster seviche onto 6 decorative spoons. Arrange each spoon on a small plate. Drizzle with lobster oil and garnish each plate with lobster roe and a piece of chive.
10. Heat about 2 tablespoons of the oil in a large pot over medium-high heat. Add the lobster shells and sauté for 2 to 3 minutes or until red.
11. Transfer to a food processor in batches and process into small pieces.
12. Return the ground shells to the pot. Add the seeds and the remaining oil and bring to a simmer. As soon as the oil is hot, remove the pot from the heat and set aside to cool to room temperature.
13. into a glass container. Cover and refrigerate until ready to use. The oil lasts for 2 to 3 months in the refrigerator.
