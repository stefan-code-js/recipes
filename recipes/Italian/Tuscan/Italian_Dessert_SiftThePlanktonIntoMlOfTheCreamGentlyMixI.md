## Method

1. Sift the plankton into 337 mL of the cream, gently mix it to incorporate, and allow it to infuse in
2. the fridge for 30 minutes. Once infused, pass it through a fine -mesh nylon sieve, transfer the
3. cream to a stand mixer, and whip it to soft peaks. Warm up the remaining 112 mL cream in a small pot on the stove. As it warms, bloom the gelatin in ice water. Once the cream is warm (approximately 70°C), squeeze out the excess water from the bloomed gelatin, and melt it in th
4. ream. Pull the pot off the stove, tak e a generous spoonful of the crème fraîche, and mix it into
5. the warm cream to temper it. Pass the mixture through a conical strainer directly into the rest ofcrème fraîche and whisk everything to incorporate. Proceed to fold in the Italian meringue in
6. two additions. Then follow with the whipped cream, folding it in in two additions. Transfer the
7. mousse to a piping bag and reserve it. This should be made just before making the cake.
8. cm ring mold for 2 guests, 8 cm ring mold for 4 guests, and a 10 cm ring mold for 6 guests. Spread the paste over the sponge and set to the side.
9. lined tray. For 2 guests, set up an 8.5 cm ring mold; for 6 guests, a 10 cm ring mold; and for 8 guests, a 12 cm ring mold.
10. Pipe 45 g of the plankton mousse into the 8.5 cm ring mold, 65 g of mousse into the 10 cm rin
11. old, and 85 g of mousse into the 12 cm ring mold. With the mousse piped in, tap the tray
12. gently to flatten its surface, then place the appropriate portions of sponge, paste -side down, in
13. the center of the mousse, and push it down slightly. Transfer the whole thing to the freezer to set. Once frozen, remove it from the freezer, and allow the cake to temper slightly. Remove thecakes from the acetate and ring molds, flip them right side up onto a cake rack, and glaze themby pouring the heated, fluid glaze over the top for an unrippled, even coating. Allow it to set, covered, in the fridge. While the cake sets, pour a bit more glaze into the small shell molds andtransfer the molds to the freezer to set. Pop the shells out of the mold when set and reserve in
14. the freezer. When ready to serve, remove the cake from the fridge to temper for 10 minutes before serving. Place a few of the glaze shells on top of the cake, season the shells with a light
15. dusting of the rose berry ginger powder, and serve with a dagger for guests to cut slices and
16. serve themselves at the table.
