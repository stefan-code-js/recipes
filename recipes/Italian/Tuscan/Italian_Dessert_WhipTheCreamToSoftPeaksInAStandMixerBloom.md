## Method

1. Whip the cream to soft peaks in a stand mixer. Bloom the gelatin in cold water and, once
2. hydrated, wring it out and tr ansfer it to a small pot with 60 g of the sea buckthorn base. Place
3. the pot on the stove and heat the mixture until the gelatin melts. Pour the hot gelatinized sea buckthorn base back into the rest of the base. Stir it around to temper and mix it well, the n
4. proceed to fold in the Italian meringue in two additions, followed by the whipped cream in two additions, until everything is well mixed. Transfer the mousse to piping bags when ready to build the cakes.
5. Bloom the gelatin in cold water and wring it out once hydrated. In a pot on the stove, heat up the sugar, glucose, and sea buckthorn juice, and melt the bloomed gelatin in this warm liquid. Once dissolved, cool the mixture down to room temperature and emul sify in the elderflower o
6. ith a rubber spatula. Transfer the mixture into a 3 L container and place it in a vacuum
7. machine, compressing it three times until de -aired and glossy. By the time its compressed, it
8. should be the proper temperature to glaze th e cakes.
9. Chopped elderflower pulp (reserved from Elderflower Syrup* production)
10. You will be building the cakes in a dome -shaped red silicone mold, with a diameter of 6 cm. In
11. equal amounts, punch out the sponge in 2 sizes, one at 4 cm and the other at 5 cm rounds. Cover the face of the sponge circles with a thin layer chopped elderflower pulp left over from the production of elderflower syrup. Pipe the mousse into the bottom o f the 6 cm red silicone
12. mold about a third the way up, then place the 4 cm sponge circle in with the chopped elderflower facing down into the mousse. Cover that with another layer of mousse, another third the way up, and place in the 5 cm circle like the f irst. Then fill the remainder of the dome
13. with more mousse to fill it up. Tap the mold down on the table to remove any air pockets and
14. scrape the surface with a pallet knife to sharpen up its edge. Transfer the tray of molds to the blast freezer to allow them to set for a minimum of 4 hours. Once set, pop out the layer cakes and transfer them to a wire rack to glaze them. Pour the glaze over the top, return the cake th
15. last freezer and repeat this glazing process two more times. Once triple glazed, hold t he cakes
16. in the fridge in a covered container until needed.
