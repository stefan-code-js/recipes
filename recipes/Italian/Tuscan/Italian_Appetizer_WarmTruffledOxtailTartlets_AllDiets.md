## Method

1. Since I opened Tru, I have served sturgeon with braised oxtail in a red wine sauce, which has been and always will be one of our signature dishes. Other than braised lamb shanks, braised oxtail is my favorite braised meat-it’s a shame it’s so underutilized. I encourage you to try it! The robustly flavored oxtail accents the meaty fish to a T, which some might find surprising. Oxtail, not unlike lamb shanks and short ribs, falls from the bone in mouthwatering shreds after it’s braised in an aromatic broth for several hours. Here, I pair it with a spiced sweet carrot puree to emphasize the earthy flavors of autumn, and serve the amuse in tiny tartlet shells. This may seem like a lot of work for such small bites, but when you read the recipe, you will see it requires more time than effort. I also think this is an outstanding way to learn about cooking the humble oxtail. You can toss the meat with pasta, make a risotto, or even serve it with fish-as I do with sturgeon.
2. carrots, the 2 largest cut into large dice and the remaining 3 coarsely chopped
3. ribs celery, cut into large dice
4. Trim the oxtails of any visible fat. Using a sharp paring knife, score the tails lengthwise. Set aside.
5. Cut an 8-inch square of cheesecloth and mound the peppercorns in the center of the square. Bring the corners of the cloth together and tie the sachet with kitchen string.
6. Heat the oil in a large, heavy-bottomed casserole or Dutch oven over medium-high heat. When the oil is almost smoking, add the oxtails and cook for 12 to 15 minutes or until they are well browned on all sides, working in batches if necessary. Remove the oxtails from the pan and set aside.
7. Reduce the heat to medium and add the onions, the diced carrots, and the celery to the pan. Cook, stirring for 8 to 10 minutes, or until the vegetables are golden brown.
8. Preheat the oven to 300°F.
9. Add the Madeira, red wine, and peppercorn sachet to the pan and bring to a boil over medium-high heat while stirring the bottom of the pan with a wooden spoon to scrape up any browned solids and dissolve them into the liquid. Reduce the heat slightly and simmer for about 15 minutes or until the liquid is reduced by half.
10. Return the oxtails to the pan, add the beef stock, and bring to a boil over medium-high heat. Remove from the heat and cover the casserole with a tight-fitting lid. Place in the center of the oven and cook for 3 to 4 hours or until the meat is tender and almost falling off the bone.
11. Remove and discard the peppercorn sachet from the casserole. Remove the oxtails and set aside to cool at room temperature. Then, transfer them to a large bowl, cover, and refrigerate until chilled.
12. Meanwhile, skim the fat from the surface of the braising liquid. Put the pan over medium-high heat and bring the liquid to a boil. Reduce the heat slightly and simmer for about 35 minutes or until the liquid is reduced by half.
13. While the liquid is reducing, put the chopped carrots in a small saucepan and cover with cold water. Bring to a boil over high heat and boil for 10 minutes or until fork-tender. Drain the carrots and transfer to a heavy-duty blender or food processor.
14. Add about ¼ cup of the water to the blender or processor and puree. With the motor running, slowly add as much of the remaining ¼ cup water as needed for a fluid consistency.
15. Scrape the puree into a small bowl and season to taste with salt and pepper. Mix in the clove and cinnamon.
16. or fine-mesh sieve into another small bowl. (If not using right away, allow to cool, cover, and refrigerate until needed. Before serving, gently reheat the sauce in a small saucepan over medium heat.)
17. Pick the meat off the bones of the chilled oxtails and discard the bones. Return the meat to the casserole and season to taste with salt and pepper. If not serving immediately, allow the braising liquid to cool to room temperature. Cover and refrigerate.
18. To serve, reheat as much of the oxtail braise as needed in a small saucepan. Spread a thin layer of the carrot puree over the bottom of each tartlet shell. Fill the shells with the warm oxtail mixture and transfer each filled tartlet to a small plate.
