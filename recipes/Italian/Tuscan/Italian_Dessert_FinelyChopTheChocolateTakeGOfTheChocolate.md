## Method

1. Finely chop the chocolate. Take 240 g of the chocolate and heat it to 50°C over a bain -marie.
2. Place the remaining 160 g chocolate in a bowl and pour the heated chocolate over the c hopped
3. chocolate. Using a rubber spatula, mix the two together until all is melted and homogeneous.
4. cut out of the top Silpat. Using a long offset spatula, e venly spread the chocolate over the cut
5. Silpat to form chocolate discs. Carefully remove the cut, top Silpat from the bottom one so as not to disturb the chocolate discs just formed. Transfer the tray to the fridge to set. Once set, use a small offset spatula to pop off the discs, and transfer them to a dry 1 L container to reserve in the fridge until you need to build the dessert.
6. Place the saffron ice cream pacos in a blast for at leas t 1 hour before you spin them. Spin the ice
7. cream in the Pacojet. Check the consistency of the ice cream and allow it to set up in the freezerif necessary. Once the ice cream is properly set, transfer it to a piping bag.
8. Have a scale setup with the wax bowls lined up on it. Pipe a thin layer of the saffron ice cream
9. onto the bottom of the wax bowl -approximately 7 to 8 g. Place one disc of Mexican chocolate
10. onto of this layer of ice cream. Pipe another layer of ice cream on top of the first chocolate
11. disc-slightly more ice cream than the last (approximately 10 g). Add the other chocolate disc on
12. top of this layer of ice cream. Pipe the final layer of ice cream on top until you reach a total of 35g of ice cream. Wet a teaspoon and use the back of it to spread the final layer of ice cream evenly, leaving a bit of space (approximately 0.5 to 1 cm) between the surface of the ice creamand rim of the bowl. Reserve these assembled ice cream bowls in 1 L containers in the freeze
13. Remove the assembled ice cream bowl from the blast chiller. Make sure the poppy seed glaze isroom temperature and in a squeeze bottle. Squeeze app roximately one spoon worth of the
14. poppy seed glaze to the top of the ice cream in the bowl. Add the sauce in such a way that it doesn’t completely cover the ice cream underneath -we are looking for an almost camouflage
15. appearance. Season the poppy seed sauc e with 6 or 7 drops of Italian balsamic vinegar and
16. dress with the anise hyssop flowers. Serve immediately.
