## Method

1. This simple idea came after a stage I did with my friend Chef Jean-Pierre Vigato, who is chef-owner of the critically acclaimed Paris restaurant Apicius. He made an amazing vegetable side dish by piping different mousses into rigatoni. At my restaurant, I stuff the rigatoni with herbed ricotta cheese and serve blanched vegetables on the side for a light, refreshing amuse. My customers love it. The trick is to cook the rigatoni only until al dente and then refrigerate it. This technique keeps it firm so it doesn’t tear when it’s stuffed, although you will note that I suggest cooking extra pasta because some inevitably split in the boiling water and others are lost to snacking!
2. large fresh basil leaves, finely chopped
3. plum tomato, diced
4. , for garnishing
5. In a large pot of lightly salted boiling water, cook the pasta for 11 to 14 minutes or until al dente. Drain and transfer to a medium-sized bowl, toss with a little olive oil to prevent sticking, and allow to cool slightly. Cover and refrigerate.
6. Stir the ricotta and basil together until well mixed. Season to taste with salt and pepper. Cover and refrigerate.
7. Slice the ends off the squash. Using a Japanese mandolin fitted with the fine-shredding blade, julienne lengthwise, avoiding the seedy center parts. If you don’t have a mandolin, shred the vegetables as thinly as possible with a small, sharp knife.
8. In a saucepan of boiling salted water, cook the green beans for 3 to 4 minutes or until crisp and tender. Drain and immediately submerge in cold water. Drain again and set aside.
9. In another saucepan of boiling salted water, blanch the shredded squash for 1 minute. Drain and immediately submerge in cold water. Drain again. Put the squash in a medium-sized bowl and set aside.
10. Toss the squash and green beans with 1 tablespoon oil, lemon juice, and salt and pepper to taste.
11. Fill a pastry bag fitted with a ⅓-inch plain tip with the ricotta filling. Pipe some of the filling into each rigatoni tube and arrange on a flat plate. (The cup of uncooked rigatoni will provide more than enough tubes of pasta. Use those that have not split during cooking.)
12. To serve, center a small mound of the squash and beans on a small plate. Top with a filled rigatoni tube, sprinkle with tomatoes, and drizzle with pesto oil. Repeat to make 5 to 9 more servings.
