## Method

1. be the case. In the heat of summer, ona picnic, or when you want something make-
2. ahead to pull and eat straight from the fridge, cold noodles are the answer. If you skim
3. historically pervasive throughout Italy as well. There they are usually served as part of
4. an insalata, but never with mayonnaise, as is common in the United States.
5. This recipe includes specific cooking instructions for the pasta, because when
6. noodles are destined for a cold preparation, they must be treated differently. The
7. two chief differences are the inclusion of additional salt in thé boiling water and the

10. further, since there are few worse textures than a soggy cold noodle.
11. thinly slice and serve with an assortment of raw, in-season vegetables. Complementary
12. cilantro, and cucumbers. MAKES 4 SERVINGS | PREPARATION TIME: 40 MINUTES
