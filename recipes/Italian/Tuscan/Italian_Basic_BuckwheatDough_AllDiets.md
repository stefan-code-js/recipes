## Method

1. BUCKWHEAT DOUGH
2. Buckwheat is actually a seed, not a grass like wheat (see page 21). When it’s milled into
3. flour, it resembles wheat, but it performs very differently and lends a pleasant nuttiness
4. to dough. Pasta made from this dough plays nicely and looks phenomenal with Matcha
5. V/2 cup buckwheat flour
6. 1. Combine the flours, eggs, and hot
7. water in the bowl of a standing mixer
8. fitted with a paddle attachment and mix
9. on low speed until a ball of dough forms.
10. by hand or in the mixer, so that the dough
11. develops elasticity and silkiness. Cover
12. 2. Alternatively, you can let the dough
13. rest for up to 24 hours in the refrigerator.
