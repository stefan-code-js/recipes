## Method

1. Add enough cold water to cover the beans by 3 inches. Bring the water to a boil over high heat and cook rapidly for 3 to 5 minutes, skimming any foam from the surface. Add the sage and sausage. Reduce the heat and simmer gently for 1 to 2 hours or until the beans are fork-tender (cooked through, but not so soft that they lose their shape). Add additional water to the pan as needed to keep the beans covered.
2. Meanwhile, put the clams, white wine, chopped shallot, and sprigs of thyme in a medium-sized saucepan. Cover and steam over high heat, shaking the pan occasionally, for about 5 minutes or until the clams have opened. Remove from the heat. Discard any clams that remain unopened. Remove the clams from the liquid, cover, and chill thoroughly. Discard the cooking liquid.
3. When the beans are done, drain the contents of the pan into a colander. Remove the sausage and set aside. Discard the sage leaves. Transfer the beans to a small bowl and season to taste with salt and pepper. If not using immediately, allow to cool, cover, and refrigerate.
4. Cut the sausage into small dice. Put in a small bowl. If not using immediately, cover and refrigerate.
5. To serve, bring the clams to room temperature and warm the beans and sausage, if necessary. Place a clam in its bottom shell on a small plate. Top with a few beans and sausage pieces and drizzle with olive oil. Garnish with chopped parsley. Repeat to make 5 to 9 more servings.
