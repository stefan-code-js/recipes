## Method

1. Mix all the ingredients together in a mixing bowl by hand until unified. Crumble the mixture
2. between your hands onto a parchment -lined gastro tray and transfer it to the freezer. Once
3. frozen, transfer the crumbs directly to the oven and bake them at 150 °C (80% fan) for 10
4. minutes. Remove from the oven, let cool, and reserve in an airtight container at room temperature.
5. Blend all the ingredients in the Thermomix until homogenized. Once blended, remove the contents of the blender jug and pass the paste through a fine tamis with a pastry scraper. Reserve this glaze in an airtight container in the fridge until needed. (When glazing a cake withthis, it should be reheated to 55°C.)
6. Place all the ingredients in a dehydrator set to 60°C and leave to dry overnight until completely
7. devoid of water. The following day, blend everything together in the Thermomix until powdered, reserve in an airtight container until needed.
8. Place the egg whites in the bowl of a stand mixer and place the sugar in a pot with a splash ofwater. Place the sugar on the stove and heat it to 121°C; when the sugar hits 100°C, turn themixer on and begin whipping the egg whites. Let the sugar continue to climb to 121°C and thenpour it into the egg whites, which at this point should be aerated but not a firm meringue. Letthe mixture continue whipping until the temperature drops to 40°C. Remove the mixture from
9. the bowl and reserve.
