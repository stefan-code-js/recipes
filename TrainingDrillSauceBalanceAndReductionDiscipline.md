# Training Drill: Sauce Balance and Reduction Discipline

## Goal

Develop flavor depth and shine without heaviness.

## Practice: Reduction

1. Reduce 1 L brown stock to 600 mL, 400 mL, 250 mL.

2. Taste each; note salt intensity and texture.

3. Identify the reduction point where flavor is full but not sticky.

## Practice: Monter au Beurre

1. Mount with cold butter cubes one at a time (1%, 2%, 4% of total weight).

2. Watch at which ratio the sauce breaks.

## Practice: Finishing Acid

1. Test finishing acids: a drop of sherry vinegar, lemon, verjus, kombucha.

2. See how each acid changes the perception of salt, body, and richness.
