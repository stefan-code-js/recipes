Place the pan of almonds over medium heat and stir  
until pale-colored. Stirring constantly, add small amounts  
of the red syrup, continuing until the almonds are coated  
to the thickness you desire. Pour the syrup in the saucepan onto the almonds and,  
using a spatula, stir until the sugar crystallizes.Stir enough red food coloring into the syrup in the mixing bowl 
until tinted the desired shade.
Tip the almonds onto a sheet of parchment paper and allow  
to cool to room temperature. Shake them gently in the drum 
sifter to remove the excess crystallized sugar.6 • 4 •  5 •

• For a thinner caramel coating, use equal quantities of sugar and water.  
For a thicker coating, use twice the weight of sugar as water. • For a stronger caramel taste, cook for a little longer  
once the nuts are coated.
• Other types of nuts can be used, or you can replace the coloring  
with flavorings such as orange flower water, spices, etc.
