## The Insight

OYSTER & 
PARSLEY 
EMULSION 
WITH SQUID­
INK-INFUSED 
TAPIOCA 
CRACKERS 
54 H0ST -JONAS CHRISTENSEN 
For this starter of oysters and parsley that head chef 
Jonas Christensen serves at H0st, he says he wanted to "take the 
seabed into the restaurant both in flavors and design." The dish is 
meant to go with the Copenhagen restaurant's champagne and 
sparkling wine. Its components are simple: an oyster-and-parsley 
emulsion is paired with squid-ink-infused tapioca crackers. The 
vibrant, almost eye-popping hue of the emulsion is echoed and 
complemented by the sprigs of greenery-and made even brighter by 
the backdrop of pale gray oyster shells and charcoal-colored crack­
ers. Here, balance is achieved by giving primacy to only one color, 
evoking unlikely life in a desolate landscape.
