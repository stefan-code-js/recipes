58 H0ST -JONAS CHRISTENSEN 
A scallop shell is at the center of both the concept and 
the execution of the birch bark-smoked scallops that head chef 
Jonas Christensen created at the Copenhagen restaurant H0st. The 
dish "symbolizes summer," Christensen says, and combines "the best 
from the sea and the best from the rural." The scallop is chopped 
up and combined with green asparagus and a vinaigrette made 
from pickled green strawberries and parsley flowers. The purple 
flowers both echo the color of the shell and invite the eye into it. 
They create an element of asymmetry, creating a pleasing dissonance 
with the dish's symmetry-and a welcome pop of vitality amid the 
rocks and shells.
