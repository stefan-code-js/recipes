## The Insight

VIENNOISERIE 
Shaping a Three-Strand Braid 
Ingredients 
Brioche dough

should be able to see the work surface between 
the plaits. This leaves enough room for the 
dough to expand and prevents it from tearing 
when baking. 
Lift the rightmost strand up and over the second, 
and set it down just inside the third. Place three strands of dough with pointed tips on 
the work surface and pinch them together at one 
end. With the open ends facing you, place two 
strands to the right and the third to the left. 
Pick up the leftmost strand.
