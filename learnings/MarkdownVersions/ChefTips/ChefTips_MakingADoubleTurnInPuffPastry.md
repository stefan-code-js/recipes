## The Insight

Puff pastry dough (see technique p. 66) and flour for dusting 
CHEFS' NOTES 
• Mark the dough lightly with your finger 
for each turn so you can keep track of how 
many turns you have made. 
• This folding technique is also called 
a "wallet" turn (tour portefeuille). 
Fold the shorter ends of the dough inward, 
one-third of the way down from the top and 
two-thirds of the way up from the bottom. ... 
Dust the work surface very lightly with flour. 
Roll the dough into a rectangle that is roughly 
three times as long as it is wide. 
Fold the dough in half. The dough is now folded 
in four, which is known as a double turn.
