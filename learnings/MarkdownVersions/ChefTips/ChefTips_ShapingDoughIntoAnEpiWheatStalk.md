## The Insight

, 
Shaping Dough into an Epi (Wheat Stalk) 
Ingredients 
Dough with a short proofing time, 
shaped into baguettes (see technique p. 51) 
and proofed 
Equipment 
Scissors 
CHEFS' NOTES 
This shape is quite fragile and breaks easily, 
so take care when removing the baked loaf 
from the oven. 
• At the end of the proofing time, when the dough 
is ready to bake, start near one end of a baguette 
and make a deep cut about three-quarters of the 
way into the dough at a 45-degree angle, using 
the scissors . 
Fold the cut piece out to the side like a kernel of 
wheat, keeping the scissors in place to prevent the 
dough from fusing back together. Repeat every 
11/2-21/2 in. (4-6 cm), folding out the pieces on 
alternate sides, to obtain a complete wheat stalk.
