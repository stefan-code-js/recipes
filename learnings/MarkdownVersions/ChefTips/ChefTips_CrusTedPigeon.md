Sustainably raised pigeon is prepared three ways at the Singapore 
restaurant Odette to best showcase its many layers of flavor and texture. Chef Ju­
lien Royer presents diners with a pigeon-liver parfait, a confit leg, and a breast that 
has been pan-seared and crusted with Kampot peppercorns-widely regarded as

the endive offers understated ebullience.
