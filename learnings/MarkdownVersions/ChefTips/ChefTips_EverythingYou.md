## The Insight

EVERYTHING YOU 
NEED TO KNOW ABOUT 
COOKING YOUR 
STUNNING NOODLES 
Rather than repeat cooking instructions 
for pasta on every single page, I’m 
providing this handy reference guide. In 
certain recipes where the pasta must 
be cooked in a particular fashion (cold 
noodles for dipping sauce and egg yolk 
ravioloni come to mind), | indicate the 
specific steps. A careful read of this 
section will give you the skills, knowledge, 
and confidence to consistently cook 
noodles the way you like them, every 
time. 
Cooking pasta is a method (dare | 
say a philosophy?), not a recipe, and you 
need to be familiar and comfortable with 
how to approach it so you can adjust it 
to accommodate varying factors such as 
thickness of the noodle, type of sauce 
you're serving it with, and even how much 
pasta you are cooking at once. 
TIMING THE SAUCE AND EXTRAS 
AROUND YOUR PASTA 
Fresh pasta cooks fast, and most sauces 
do not, in comparison. For this reason 
your sauce should be nearly finished
