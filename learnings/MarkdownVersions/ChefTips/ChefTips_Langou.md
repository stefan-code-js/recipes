## The Insight

LANGOU­

ANDREAS BRETTMARK 
At Natur, a restaurant in Gothenburg, 
Sweden, langoustines blend seamlessly into an 
earthy but well-considered landscape. Chef 
Andreas Brettmark panfries and glazes the shellfish 
and serves them with fermented celeriac, crispy 
cabbage, chives, tapioca, and a beurre blanc. The 
idea behind the dish, Brettmark explains, was "to 
use some of last year's celeriac, and get the acidity 
from the juice into the sauce." The simpatico flavors 
are mirrored by the dish's presentation, which 
employs relaxed, rustic forms whose shapes are 
enhanced by the rough-hewn but clean lines of the 
serving bowl. Its white hue adds vibrancy to the 
dish's laidback color palette, making its ingredients 
pop and shine.
