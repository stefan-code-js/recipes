## The Insight

TARTINE BREAD
118COUNTRY RYE
Rye flour has a distinct sweet grain flavor that develops when the dough is fer -
mented with natural leaven. For some rye breads, such as traditional German 
ryes, an intensely sour flavor is preferred and is achieved by a long fermentation.  
For the country rye loaves here, I use just enough rye flour to impart 
a distinct rye flavor and sweetness, while keeping sourness to a minimum. The 
whole-rye flour adds a slight gray cast and distinct tenderness to the crumb.
When using rye in combination with wheat flour, you can vary the por -
tion of rye to suit your taste: as you increase the percentage of rye flour to wheat, 
the loaves will become more dense due to the lack of gluten in rye.
Use a medium-fine grind of whole-rye flour as opposed to a coarse pumper-
nickel rye, which will yield a very different result.
