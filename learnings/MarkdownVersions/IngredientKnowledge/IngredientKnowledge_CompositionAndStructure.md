## The Insight

458 Chapter 16  understanding meats and game
COMPOSITION AND STRUCTURE
to understand how meats react to cooking processes, we need to know what kinds of molecules 
make up meat tissue and what kinds of structures are formed from those components.
Meat  COMpONeNt S
muscle tissue consists of three major components: water, protein, and fat. i n addition, a small but 
important amount of carbohydrate can be found in muscle tissues.
Water
Water is about 75 percent of muscle tissue. With such a high percentage of water, you can see why 
shrinkage can be a big problem in cooking meat. too much moisture loss means dry meat, loss of 
weight, and loss of profit.
Protein
Protein is an important nutrient and the most abundant solid material in meat. a bout 20 percent of 
muscle tissue is protein.
as we learned in Chapter 6, protein coagulates when it is heated. this means it becomes 
firmer and loses moisture. Coagulation is related to doneness. i n dry-heat cooking, when protein 
has coagulated t
