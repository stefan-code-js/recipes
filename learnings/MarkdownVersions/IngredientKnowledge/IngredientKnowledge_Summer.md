## The Insight

SUMMER
SUMMER
During
the
summer
we’re
at
the
markets
almost
every
day.
Summer is
abundant
with
fruits
and
vegetables
and
requires
you
to
be
in
close
touch
with
the
farmers.
The
seasons
within
the
season
pass
quickly;
to
get
produce
at
its
peak,
you
need
to
pay
attention.
When
I
was
growing
up,
my
mom
did
all
the
cooking
at
home,
and
she
bought
her
ingredients
from
nearby
farms.
We
also
had
a
garden
where
we
grew
some
of
our
own
tomatoes,
beans,
herbs,
and
rasp-
berries.
We
even
had
a
cherry
tree.
To
my
chagrin,
summer
meant
spending
time
in
that
garden,
while
all
my
friends
were
having
fun
on
the
beach.
I
would
also
help
in
the
kitchen
—
not
actually
cooking,
just
doing
the
boring
stuff:
washing
greens,
cleaning
vegetables,
peeling
garlic,
pitting
cherries.
Although
there
was
something
beautiful
about
cleaning
vegetables
that
had
just
come
out
of
the
ground,
I
couldn’t
stand
the
smell
of
my
hands
after
peeling
enough
garlic
to
make
pesto,
and
it
took
forever
to
pit
enough
cherries
