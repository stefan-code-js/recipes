## The Insight

in the 1950s. Looking for a way to use 
up the scraps left over from mozzarella 
production, they began to make a final 
“kitchen sink” cheese at the end of the 
day. They kneaded the mozzarella scraps 
into a vessel-like form, poured in some 
fresh cream for binding, and tied it up in 
a pretty topknot. Thus, burrata was born, 
and the world—well, Puglia—rejoiced! 
Because burrata is so perishable, it 
rarely traveled outside that region until 
recently, when global demand caused 
cheesemakers to duplicate burrata (not 
quite as well, but still) with pasteurized 
dairy. 
PASTA, PRETTY PLEASE Which brings me to my next point. 
Those cheesemakers employed a very 
important Italian notion called... 
Cucina povera literally means “poor 
kitchen,” but there's more to the story. 
Cucina povera has roots in southern ltaly, 
and hearkens back especially to several 
postwar periods when food was scarce 
for everyday people. Beyond just the 
notion that nothing should go to waste,
