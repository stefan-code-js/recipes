## The Insight

94 Spice Profiles
Herbalists throughout the ages, from 
the Vedic tradition of India to the authors of Ancient Greek medical texts, have endorsed fennel for its sight-restoring powers and as an antidote to snake bites. The Greek  
for fennel is maratho, and the plains  
of Marathon, where the Greeks won  
a decisive battle against the Persians

in part to the King of the Franks, Emperor Charlemagne (742–814 CE),  
who demanded that it be cultivated

to the Americas and Australia, where  
wild escapees are now considered noxious weeds.
