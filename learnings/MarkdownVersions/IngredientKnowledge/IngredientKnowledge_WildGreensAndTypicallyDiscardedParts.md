## The Insight

wild greens, and typically discarded parts 
of vegetables, such as turnip tops, so 
they could feed their families. 
Meat was expensive and uncommon, 
and if it was procured, no part went 
unused. Famous dishes borne of cucina 
povera often contain organ meats like 
tripe, brains, and liver. Some families 
could afford to buy tripe only once a 
week, and it was sold preboiled for 
convenience from shops called tripperie 
that were as common as vegetable 
vendors in any given villagio at the turn 
of the twentieth century. Those who 
could not afford the tripe itself had to 
make do with the broth used to boil it. 
It was a welcome flavoring for cheap 
legumes and grains, such as chickpeas 
and rice. Pasta is the very definition of 
cucina povera. By mixing water (or 
eggs) with flour, forming it into a paste, 
then somehow cutting and drying it, 
early noodle makers the world over 
were preserving flour to make it last 
over long periods of famine, miseria, or 
swashbuckling adventures
