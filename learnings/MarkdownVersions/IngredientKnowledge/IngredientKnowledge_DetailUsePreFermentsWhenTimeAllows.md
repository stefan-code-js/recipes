DETAIL 2: USE PRE-FERMENTS WHEN TIME ALLOWS
The recipes in this book use one of two approaches to making bread with a complex
flavor profile. The first approach is to make what’s called a straight dough with a slow
rise, which means using less yeast and allowing much more time for rising than in
traditional recipes—at least five hours between mixing and shaping into loaves. The
second approach is enhancing fermentation by adding pre-fermented dough or a levain
made up many hours before being included in the final dough mix.
Poolish and biga are examples of commonly used pre-ferments. Both are made with a
very small amount of commercial yeast. When using a pre-ferment, you mix 30 to 80
percent of the total flour in the recipe with water and a small amount of yeast ahead of
time, let it ferment (usually overnight), and then add the resulting bubbly, fragrant pre-
fermented mixture to the rest of the ingredients in the final dough. This process lends
