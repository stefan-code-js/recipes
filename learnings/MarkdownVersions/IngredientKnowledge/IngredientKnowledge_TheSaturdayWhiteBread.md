## The Insight

THE SATURDAY WHITE BREAD
This recipe is designed for someone who wants to make good, crusty loaves of white
bread from start to finish in one day. Mix the dough first thing in the morning, shape it

dinner. It’s also a good first recipe to try from this book to help you get familiar with my

delicious bread that’s great as a dinner bread and also works well for sandwiches and
toast.

You can bake one or two loaves from this recipe. If you bake just one loaf, you can
divide the remaining dough into two or three
