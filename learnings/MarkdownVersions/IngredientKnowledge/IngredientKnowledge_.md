## The Insight

18
direction
of
the
restaurant,
and
with
our
ambitious
goals,
we
knew
we
needed
everyone’s
involvement
and
help.
We
also
recognized
the
degree
to
which
feeling
a
sense
of
ownership
can
motivate
people
to
work
that
much
harder.
Danny
always
gave
us
complete
autonomy,
and
it
inspired
to
invest
ourselves
completely
in
the
restaurant.
Although
initially
hesitant,
as
we
are
each
a
bit
controlling,
we
decided
to
trust
in
the
power
of
delegation
and
we
empowered
our
team.
We
relinquished
control
over
many
areas
of
the
restaurant
—
the
beer
program,
the
spirits
program,
the
cheese
program,
team
building,
linens,
music,
coffee,
tea,
china,
glass,
silver,
recipe
testing.
The
list
goes
on.
We
were
still
involved
in
everything,
but
we
gave
autonomy,
inspir-
ing
each
to
strive
to
make
their
area
of
ownership
the
best
it
could
be.
Suddenly,
by
increasing
the
number
of
people
with
control
over
all
the
different
areas
of
the
restaurant,
we
found
ourselves
capable
of
doing
much
more,
and
doing
