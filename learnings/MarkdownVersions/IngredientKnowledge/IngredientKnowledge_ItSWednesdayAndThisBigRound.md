## The Insight

The 3-Kilo 
Boule
It’s Wednesday, and this big, round 
boule
 of levain bread baked Monday morning
—about 16 inches in diameter and weighing in at more than 6 pounds—may be at
its best right now. Like all of my big levain loaves, the 3-kilo 
boule
 improves with
age for several days after it’s been baked. There’s something unique about the way
flavors develop in big loaves. The flavors integrate and mellow with time, the
crumb remains soft, and the crust stays firm yet pliable. I love the variety of textures
in this monster. The rich, earthy, sometimes slightly bitter flavor of the crust
fascinates me when I think of the field of wheat it came from. The ingredients?
Flour, water, salt, and yeast. Bet you saw that coming.
Breads of this size probably date back to times when people only had access to
fresh bread one or two days each week and needed loaves large enough to last until
the next baking day. There’s a connection to European village life, back to when
bread was a dietary staple
