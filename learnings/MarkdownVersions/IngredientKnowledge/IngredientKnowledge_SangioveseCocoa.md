## The Insight

pine nuts, and foie gras. 
13---. Pumpkin, apricot, 
and Parmesan ravioli 
with lumpfish roe and 
macaroons. 13 
That reduction has a parallel in Rosati's work as a photographer and 
stylist: today, his photographs entail fewer ingredients and props. "Lots of stylists 
use too many complements and props, often distracting the viewer's attention from 
the main dish," he explains. "I decided to eliminate all the superficial elements only 
to focus on the ingredients and the meaning of the dish." The plate itself, he says, is 
"the tool to create a harmonic composition," and for that reason he has placed 
increasing focus on using handmade ceramics in his photographs. 
In turn, styling and photography have changed the way Rosati thinks 
about food. "It helped me to give more value to the ingredients and to know how to 
enhance them with colors and shapes," he says. "Food is important. It is our source 
of life. It shouldn't be wasted. It should be loved."
