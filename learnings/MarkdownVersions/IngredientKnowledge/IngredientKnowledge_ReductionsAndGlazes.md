REDUCTIONS AND GLAZES
stocks are concentrated by boiling or simmering them to evaporate part of the water. this is called 
making a reduction, or reducing.
Reduction is an important technique in sauce-making and in many other areas of cooking

What  are  GLaZeS?
A glaze—or, in French, glace (glahss)—is a stock reduced until it coats the back of a spoon. It is so 
concentrated—reduced by three-fourths or more—that it is solid and rubbery when refrigerated.
Glazes are used as flavorings in sauce-making and in some meat, poultry, fish, and vegetable 
preparations. only small amounts are needed because they are so concentrated.
Glazes diluted to original strength do not taste like the stocks they were made from. the long 
cooking changes the flavors somewhat.
