Noma is about transformation. At the start: local ingre­

It's also an experience: Visitors to Noma walk the 
length of a perennial meadow dotted with bulbs in spring 
and flowers in summer. A mix of grasses evokes wild

garden moves with the seasons, too. Plants grow to a high 
point in summer and then decay, revealing their skeletal 
stems and seed heads. Insects and birds come and go.

of abandoned elevated train tracks. The brief there was
