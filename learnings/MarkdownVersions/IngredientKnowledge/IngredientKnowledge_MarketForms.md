## The Insight

Most mussels are sold alive in the shell. Many are also sold shucked and 
packed in brine.
Checking Freshness
1. like oysters and clams, mussels must be alive to be good to eat. Check for tightly closed shells or shells that just close when jostled.
2. discard any mussels that are very light in weight or seem to be hollow. also, discard any that are much too heavy—they are probably full of sand.
Cleaning
1. Clean shells thoroughly:
•	scrub well under cold running water.
•	scrape off barnacles, if any, with a clam knife.
•	remove the beard, a fibrous appendage protruding from between the shells (f ig. 20.10).  
do not do this until just before cooking, because it may kill the shellfish.
2. Mussels may be sandy inside if not commercially grown. they may be soaked in brine and flour or cornmeal like clams (see previous section) to rid them of sand.FIGURE 20.9 Opening clams.
