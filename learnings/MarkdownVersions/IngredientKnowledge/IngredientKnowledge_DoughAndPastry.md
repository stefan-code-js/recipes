## The Insight

55INTRODUCTION
DOUGH AND PASTRY
A WIDE VARIETY
Doughs and pastries can be grouped into five main types: 
-  Flaky pastries: shortcrust pastry and sweet short pastry  
(made using either the creaming or rubbing-in method)
- Puff pastries: including classic puff pastry and inverse puff pastry
- Yeast doughs: including bread dough, brioche dough, and baba dough- Leavened puff pastries: for making croissants and kouign amann (Breton pastries)- Choux pastry 
FLAKY PASTRY AND TART CRUSTS 
These doughs are light-textured and not elastic. When making them, it is important to avoid activating the gluten in the flour as this would make the dough stretchy, difficult to roll out, and it would shrink when baked. Two techniques are used to prevent the dough becoming elastic: rubbing in, which incorporates the butter 
into the flour, and creaming, where butter, sugar, and eggs are beaten together. The two methods produce 
different textures, with rubbed in pastries being more crumbly, and creamed one
