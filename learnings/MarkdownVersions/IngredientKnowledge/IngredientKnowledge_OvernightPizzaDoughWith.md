## The Insight

OVERNIGHT PIZZA DOUGH WITH
LEVAIN
If you’ve built a levain culture, when you use it to make bread you’ll have enough left to
make pizza dough too. This pure levain dough recipe, without added baker’s yeast,
works on a convenient schedule and produces pizza crust with nice poofiness in the rim
and a bit more acidity and complexity in taste from the leavening. I don’t mean to
understate it, this is a great dough. As with all of the pizza doughs in this book, use a
high-quality all-purpose white flour, preferably 00 flour (see 
Pizza Dough Overview
),
ideally Caputo brand.
THIS RECIPE MAKES FIVE 340-GRAM DOUGH BALLS,
 each of which will yield a thin-crust pizza-
stone pizza about 12 inches in diameter or a thick-crust iron-skillet pizza. If
you use this 
dough for focaccia
, for details on amounts of dough for different
applications.
BULK FERMENTATION:
 12 to 14 hours
PROOF TIME:
 At least 6 hours
SAMPLE SCHEDULE:
 Feed the levain in the morning, mix the dough at 7 p.m., shape
into dough
