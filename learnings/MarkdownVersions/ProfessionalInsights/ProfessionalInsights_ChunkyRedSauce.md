## The Insight

CHUNKY RED SAUCE
Sometimes I want a chunkier sauce, and sometimes I like a sauce with a more pure
tomato flavor. This recipes satisfies both desires. Again, San Marzano tomatoes are
ideal, but if you can’t find them, you can substitute the best-quality canned plum tomatoes
available.
MAKES ENOUGH SAUCE FOR TWO TO THREE 12-INCH ROUND PIZZAS
1 (28-ounce) can whole San Marzano tomatoes
1½ tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil
Sea salt
1.
 Place a colander over a large bowl. Drain the tomatoes for 10 to 15 minutes.
2.
 Tilt the colander and use a wooden spoon to repeatedly push the tomatoes back and
forth to break them into a chunky pulp and drain most of the remaining juice. Do this for
about 30 seconds, then pour the pulp into a bowl. (Reserve the juice for another use.)
Stir in the olive oil and season with salt to taste.
