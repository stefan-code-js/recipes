icings or frostings (the two terms mean the same thing) are sweet coatings for cakes and other 
baked goods. icings have three main functions:
1. They improve the keeping qualities of the cake by forming a protective coating around it.
2. They contribute flavor and richness.
3. They improve appearance.
There are six basic kinds of icing:
Fondant Foam-type icing Flat-type icing
Buttercream Fudge-type icing Royal or decorator’s icing
in addition, we consider two other preparations for cakes:
glazes Fillings
Use top-quality flavorings for icings so they enhance the cake rather than detract from it. 
Use moderation when adding flavorings and colors. Flavors should be light and delicate. c olors 
should be delicate, pastel shades—except chocolate, of course.
GUIDELINES for Using Fondant
1. Heat fondant over a warm-water bath, stirring constantly, to thin the icing and make it pour-
able.
