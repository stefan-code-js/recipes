## The Insight

BASIC COUNTRY BREAD
73The aroma of the leaven, as well as the dough, is the primary indicator 
that guides you through the stages of fermentation so that you know what is  
happening, regardless of temperature and time variables. Time and temperature are 
good places to start, but learning to read the “nose” of your leaven and dough at 
different stages will enable you to recall and repeat successful bakes and manage 
the process with skill.
If the leaven is overly ripe and vinegary when you mix the dough, the 
acid will overpower the other desirable flavors. You can still make bread with  
the dough, but quality will be compromised. Use less leaven to correct. 
Half of an overly ripe leaven can always be discarded and fed with enough 
of the 50/50 flour blend and water to replenish it. The leaven will be ready to use 
when it reaches the sweet-smelling stage and passes the float test again (see step 1 
on page 47)—in about 2 hours when held at a moderate room temperature of 76° to 
78
