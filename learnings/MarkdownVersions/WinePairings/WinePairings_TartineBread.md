## The Insight

TARTINE BREAD
232Jambon Buerre Tartine
Ham, butter, bread—these sandwiches stock road-stop stations and supermarkets 
across France. A more sophisticated version of this combination can be found in 
wine bars in Paris, eaten as a light lunch or an afternoon snack with a glass of wine. 
Use the best ham you can find sliced thin. Cut the soft butter as you would cheese, 
and spread on the bread. Sandwich the ham between buttered slices of the Basic 
Country Bread (page 45).
