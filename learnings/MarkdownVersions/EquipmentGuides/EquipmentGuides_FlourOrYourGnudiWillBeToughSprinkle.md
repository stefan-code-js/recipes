## The Insight

flour or your gnudi will be tough. Sprinkle 
flour over the mixture until the outsides 
are all coated and not sticking to the 
bowl. 
3. Line a sheet pan with parchment 
paper and flour the parchment 
generously. Flour your hands and gently 
tear off a 1-inch chunk of dough (or you 
can use a small scoop to portion out 
your chunks more evenly). Roll the dough 
between your floured palms just until a 
ball forms; it should be nearly the size 
of a Ping-Pong ball. Do not over-roll or 
you'll wind up with tough gnudi. Place the 
dough ball on the sheet pan and repeat 
to roll the rest of the dough. Strive for 
uniformity in size. If some are bigger or 
smaller, you will wind up with some that 
are mushy and overcooked and some 
that are liquidy inside. 
4. Cover the sheet pan and refrigerate 
immediately for at least 30 minutes so 
they have a chance to firm up. This pasta 
does not store well, so | recommend 
cooking within 3 hours. 5. Bring a generous amount of salted 
water to a boil
