## The Insight

CULURGIONES 
This pinched packet of pasta is not for the pusillanimous. It’s one of the trickier shapes 
to master, but boy, when you do, it’s one of the most satisfying to both eat and gaze 
lovingly upon. The word culurgiones originated in Sardinian dialect, which is why it 
sounds so unlike other Italian words, not to mention ends in an “s.” The shape is formed 
to resemble a grain of wheat, and the dialect roughly translates to “little bundles.” 
Classic culurgiones filling is potato-based, often with one of the many pecorino 
cheeses that are stars of Sardinia. You may choose any of the fillings in chapter 6 
(except the burrata), but you'll want to make the filling on the stiff side, as a runny filling 
will make it impossible to complete the pinches properly. If you're really dying to try 
out the technique but you're feeling filling fatigue, you can cheat and stuff these with 
mozzarella ciliegine, a.k.a. the tiniest mozzarella balls you can find.
