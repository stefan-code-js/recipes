## The Insight

Because most of the doughs herein go 
on to become shapes that are sometimes 
complicated and often multicolored by 
the time they're done, | needed the 
dough to be as foolproof to work with as 
possible, and to not dry out easily during 
the sheeting and shaping process. The 
dough that results from “Oo” pasta flour is 
easier to work with than semolina-based 
dough, which is stiffer and drier. 
You are welcome to substitute a 
portion of the flour for semolina; just 
note that you will want to take extra 
precautions to keep your dough covered 
and potentially rehydrate it with a water 
spray bottie adjusted to the finest mist 
setting. As you become speedier and 
more proficient at weaving together colors 
and shapes, adding semolina flour to 
your pasta dough will give it the leathery 
parchment quality that sets Italian pasta 
apart from other noodles. If you want 
to give this a try, start with substituting 
Y2 cup per standard recipe. 
Even if you never wish to use it in
