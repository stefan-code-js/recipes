## The Insight

106 Spice Profiles
Native only to the tiny Banda Islands 
in the Moluccas (Maluku) archipelago of Indonesia, mace was being traded with the Byzantine empire by the  
6th century ce, where it was widely  
valued as a cure-all, food preservative, fumigant, and aphrodisiac. By the Middle Ages, mace had become one of the most sought-after and expensive spices of European cuisine. The appetite for these spices prompted a centuries-long, bloody power struggle between the Portuguese, Dutch, and English to gain control of the growing regions. Eventually, the English managed to establish their own supply by successfully transplanting nutmeg trees, along with their soil, to several of their colonies, including Grenada and Sri Lanka. With greater availability, nutmeg and mace overtook saffron  
and mustard as the spices of choice  
in Western cuisine, with mace more common (and cheaper) than nutmeg. 
Region of cultivation
Mace is cultivated across the Maluku 
(Moluccas) archipelago of Indonesia,
