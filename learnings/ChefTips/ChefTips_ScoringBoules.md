• • 
At the end of the proofing time, when the dough is ready to bake, dust 
the boules evenly with flour. Using the lame, make a straight cut across 
the center of each boule from one side to the other. Starting from the 
center, make perpendicular cuts on either side of this line to form a cross. 
Make diagonal slashes in each quarter. 
CHEFS' NOTES 
Make sure you never cut twice in the same place 
(in the center of the cross, for instance), because the dough 
will open up too much during baking.
