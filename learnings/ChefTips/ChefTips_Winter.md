## The Insight

WINTER
WINTER
New
York
winters
are
cold,
and
they
remind
me
of
home,
especially
when
it
snows.
I
always
end
up
spending
more
time
around
the
stove
than
at
the
markets,
as
not
much
is
really
growing
during
those
months.
You
pretty
much
know
what
you
have
to
work
with.
The
ingredients
are
still
exciting:
all
the
citrus,
bitter
greens,
root
veg-
etables,
and
of
course
the
black
truffles.
The
cold
water
produces
the
best
seafood:
oysters,
sea
urchin,
lobster,
and
clams.
Winter
is
truly
about
the
craft
of
cooking.
Vegetables
like
celery
root,
sunchokes,
and
parsnips
require
real
technique
to
make
them
taste
good.
Dishes
like
the
cured
leg
of
pork,
the
braised
veal
cheeks,
the
whole
roasted
chicken
with
stuffing
underneath
the
skin
—
they
require
time
and
commitment.
Working
my
way
through
the
kitchens
of
my
youth,
I
learned
that
cooking
is
repetitive.
In
restaurants,
many
of
the
same
tasks
are
done
every
day.
I
would
pick
herbs,
cut
mirepoix,
and
roll
potato
gnocchi
