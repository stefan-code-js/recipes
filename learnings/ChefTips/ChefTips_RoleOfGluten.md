## The Insight

THE 
ROLE OF GLUTEN 
AND ENZYMES
The main reason wheat flour produces such excellent bread is the presence of proteins
that produce gluten. Other members of the wheat family, such as spelt and kamut, also
contain gluten, as do rye, barley, and triticale (a hybrid of wheat and rye). Wheat
produces a greater amount of gluten than rye and barley, allowing it to hold more gas,
and as a result, wheat produces a lighter, airier bread.
Another critical component in both wheat and rye is the enzyme 
amylase. When water
is added to these flours, the amylase is activated and begins its work of breaking down
complex sugars in the endosperm into simple sugars that yeast can feed on. The yeast
multiply and eventually produce gases, and the gases are contained by the gluten network
formed by the proteins, allowing the bread to rise. Without the special proteins that form
gluten (glutenin and gliadin) and the enzymes present in wheat and rye, we would all be
eating crackers. Although it isn’t necessa
