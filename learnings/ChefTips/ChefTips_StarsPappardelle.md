## The Insight

STARS PAPPARDELLE 
I've used various types of cutters to make shapes in pasta, and when feasible | prefer 
to use plunger-style cutters because they really save the tips of my fingers from 
burning clean off after I’ve cut out about two hundred of the same shape. If you have 
only a metal cookie cutter, it will certainly work, but plunger cutters can be found 
inexpensively at most cooking or craft stores as well as online. As with all the patterns 
in this book, you don’t need to cut the finished star sheets into pappardelle. Farfalle, 
lasagne sheets, or any other noodles on the larger side would also showcase this 
pattern well. MAKES 4 SERVINGS
