## The Insight

186 Chapter 9  sauces
•	some modern chefs feel espagnole is too heavy for modern tastes and that lighter sauces are 
required. These chefs prepare demi-glace from fond lié by reducing it with mirepoix, white 
wine, and seasonings, or by simply reducing by half a flavorful brown stock. In other words, 
demi-glace may be considered a well-flavored brown stock, reduced by half (demi means “half”), thickened with roux or other starch, or left unthickened (except by natural gelatin).
3. Small sauces listed twice.Notice, for example, that mushroom sauce is listed under both chicken velouté and fish velouté. 
This means you should use the stock of the product you are serving with the sauce. Mushroom 
sauce for chicken should be made with chicken velouté, for fish, with fish velouté. To be even more confusing, mushroom sauce is also made with brown sauce. Bercy sauce is also made as 
both a white and a brown sauce. These are considered unrelated sauces that happen to have 
the same name.
