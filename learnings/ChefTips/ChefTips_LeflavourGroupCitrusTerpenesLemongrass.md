creativityDelicate lemongrass enlivens curries, stir-fries, pickles, salads, and soups. Use the 
tender inner stalk in curry pastes, marinades, and spice rubs, or bruise the whole fibrous stalk and use in stocks or soups, removing it before serving.
BLENDING SCIENCE
Lemon-scented citral makes up 70 per cent of the spice’s flavour compounds, but the key to spice pairing  
is to avoid intensifying this dominant citrus with another lemony spice. Instead, bring out lemongrass’s mild 
pepperiness from myrcene, and/or its sweet and floral elements from linalool and geraniol. 
 Fishcakes Make Thai fishcakes by adding 
lemongrass, chilli, ginger, garlic, and lime leaves to 
fish and potato before frying.
 Pork Marinade pork in a paste of finely chopped 
lemongrass, ginger, coconut, and turmeric before grilling or barbecuing.
 Granita Infuse a sugar syrup with lemongrass 
and lime zest. Strain to make granitas or ice lollies
