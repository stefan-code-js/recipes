## The Insight

32 SQUID-INK 
OREO 
THE MUSKET ROOM 
MATT LAMBERT 
For the savory riff on an Oreo cookie 
that he created at his New York restaurant, the 
Musket Room, chef Matt Lambert sandwiched 
lightly poached squid between squid-ink short­
bread. To serve the "cookie," he wanted to plate 
it in a way that would add an element of drama to 
the dish, which was served as part of a series of 
small courses. The cookie sits on top of charcoal, 
which enhances its air of mystery; it could have 
been coughed up by a volcano, or washed up on 
a primordial shore. The wooden box emphasizes 
the idea of the cookie as a remnant of some kind 
of prehistoric geological event; it's a treasure 
emerging from the mists of time.
