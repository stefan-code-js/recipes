GREEN STRAWBERRIES, 
YMER& 
230 FENNEL POLLEN 
ATERA -RONNY EMBORG 
At the two-Michelin-starred New Yo:·k restaurant Atera, chef Ronny 
Emborg gives green strawberries an almost prehistoric spin: they could be dinosaur 
eggs, or outcroppings of a newly formed earth. To achieve this effect, Emborg 
freeze-dries the strawberries at different temperatures, a process that takes 21 
hours. He serves them with ymer (a Danish soured milk) that has been dusted with 
fennel pollen from flowers that Emborg dries in the restaurant. The greenish-yellow 
tint of the pollen speaks to the pale green of the strawberries, creating a call and 
response that evokes signs of life in a barren, unforgiving land.
