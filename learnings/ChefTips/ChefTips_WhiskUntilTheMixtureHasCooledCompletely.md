Whisk until the mixture has cooled completely. 
 When the required temperature of the syrup is reached, very 
carefully pour it over the partially whisked egg whites in a thin, 
steady stream, taking care not to let it touch the beaters and whisking continuously. Reduce to medium speed after 2 minutes.When the temperature of the syrup reaches 230°F  (110°C ),  
begin whisking the egg whites in the stand mixer at high speed.

CHEFS’ NOTES
• The egg whites must be whisked until they are frothy  
so as to produce a smooth, glossy meringue. 
• If the meringue is to be incorporated into a mousse,  
the required temperature depends on how fragile the mousse  
ingredients are. For a chocolate mousse, it should be between  
113°F  and 122°F  (45°C  and 50°C ) and for a fruit mousse,  
between 95°F  and 100°F  (35°C  and 40°C ). 
• For creamy mixtures being “lightened” with meringue,  
incorporate the meringue at 75°F  (25°C ), particularly if the mixture  
contains butter, suc
