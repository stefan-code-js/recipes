## The Insight

USING YOUR KITCHEN SCALE
Put your empty container on the scale, push the scale’s “zero” button (sometimes
labeled “tare”), and after the scales zeroes out, carefully pour in the ingredient until
you reach the desired weight. When you have multiple ingredients to add to the
container, such as two or three different kinds of flour, just press the “zero” button
after each addition.
Incorporating the Flour and Water
Working directly in the 12-quart dough tub, mix the flour and water with one hand just
until incorporated. Your hand will get sticky with dough. Don’t worry; you need to get
used to using your hand as an implement. Even though dough bits are sticking to you (just
like they would stick to a dough hook), keep mixing until the flour and water are
integrated. Any dough clumps should be pinched through with your hand. After mixing,
use your free hand to squeegee the dough that’s stuck to your working hand into the tub.
Put a lid on the container and let the dough rest for 20 to 30 m
