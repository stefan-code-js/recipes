## The Insight

CUCUMBER­
AVOCADO GAZPACHO 
WITH NORI 
8 JODI MORENO 
Jodi Moreno's cucumber-avocado gazpacho is the epitome of easy refresh­
ment. A New York City-based natural foods chef and cookbook author, Moreno puts 
cucumber, avocado, olive oil, white wine vinegar, shallots, garlic, red pepper flakes, and salt 
in a mixer, blending them for two minutes. She garnishes it with nori gomasio; its salty 
crunch lends a compelling textural contrast to the soup's creaminess. Here, the nori is 
accompanied by nasturtium leaves, lightly fried kelp, fennel fronds, salad burnet, and 
purple micro-kale. Photographer Gabriel Cabrera added them to play with different 
textures and provide focal points for the eye to travel around the dish. He finished it with 
a drizzle of sesame oil, which, Cabrera explains, "helps break the shapes into an organic 
arrangement so it feels natural."
