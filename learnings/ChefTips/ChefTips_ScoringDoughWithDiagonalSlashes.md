## The Insight

Scoring Dough with Diagonal Slashes 
Ingredients 
Porous, fragile dough, such as rye 
or whole wheat, or aough 
for a Vienna-style bread, shaped 
Flour for dusting 
Equipment 
Bread lame After shaping the dough, dust it evenly with flour. Using the lame, make 
relatively deep parallel diagonal cuts across the dough at a 45-degree 
angle, making sure the cuts are evenly spaced. 
CHEFS' NOTES 
If the slashes are far apart, you can make them deeper 
so that the pattern stands out more after baking.
