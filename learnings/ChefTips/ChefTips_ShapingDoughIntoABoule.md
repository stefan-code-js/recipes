## The Insight

BREAD 
Shaping Dough into a Boule 
Ingredients 
Dough 
so CHEFS' NOTES 
• The dough has sufficient strength 
if your fingertips do not leave a mark 
when pressed on the surface. 
•To make a large boule, perform the same 
turning action using two hands: both little 
fingers should cup the dough at its base 
as you rotate it. 
Pull up one side of the dough to make a flap and 
fold this toward the center. The flap should be 
twice as long as the rest of the dough. Pull up 
a corner of the first fold and fold it toward 
the center. Continue around the dough. Make 
7-8 folds for each boule, as the goal is to have as 
many as possible to give the dough strength. Flatten the dough using the palm of your hand. 
Turn the boule over and roll it against the work 
surface. Your thumb and little finger should touch 
the work surface and cup the dough gently at its 
base as you rotate it to make it smooth and taut.
