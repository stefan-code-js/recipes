## The Insight

SPRING ONION 
WITH BUTTERMILK 
& HORSERADISH 
74 DRAGSHOLM SLOT -CLAUS HENRIKSEN 
Made in the summer, when spring onion is at its best, this simple dish 
at Denmark's Dragsholm Slot illustrates the interplay of restraint and bounty, with 
the latter being confined to the flavors of the spring onion and the buttermilk­
horseradish sauce that accompanies it. Chef Claus Henriksen cooks the spring 
onion in butter and arranges it in the blindingly white sauce to best show off its 
verdant color; a few leaves and red petals of nasturtium cress complete the display. 
The brown plate recalls the soil, referencing the origin of the dish's components 
with quiet, earthy elegance.
