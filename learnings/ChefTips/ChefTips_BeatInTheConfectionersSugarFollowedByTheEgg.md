Beat in the confectioners’ sugar, followed by the egg  
and vanilla seeds.
Top each rosette with an almond. Allow to stand at cool room 
temperature for 2–3  hours, so a crust forms on the surface. 
Preheat the oven to 425°F  (220°C /Gas mark 7 ) and bake  
for 10 minutes, until a light golden color. Transfer to a rack  
and allow to cool.2 •
