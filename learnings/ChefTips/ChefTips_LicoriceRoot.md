## The Insight

LICORICE ROOT 
HIDE -OLLIE DABBOUS

licorice-infused parfait endowed with white chocolate and whipped cream. The 
parfait is frozen at the end of the licorice stick and dipped into the marshmallow, 
which is then frozen and blowtorched right before serving. Its notes of burnt 
meringue and aniseed make it a harmonious pairing with an after-dinner coffee, 
observes chef Ollie Dabbous. "I quite like ending in something bitter," he says.
