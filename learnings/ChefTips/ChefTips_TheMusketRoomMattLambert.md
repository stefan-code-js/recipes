## The Insight

THE MUSKET ROOM -MATT LAMBERT 
Because the Musket Room serves modern interpretations of New 
Zealand cooking, chef Matt Lambert knew he had to put pavlova-which he calls 
a "Kiwi classic" -on the New York restaurant's menu. "You can't not do it," he says. 
"It's the one dessert at every family occasion." Lambert's version deconstructs the 
pavlova: its centerpiece is a passion fruit meringue stuffed with marshmallow fluff, 
surrounded by whipped cream, passion fruit curd, fresh passion fruit, strawberries, 
and pansies. The cylindrical meringue provides a striking focal point to the plate, 
while the placement of its accompaniments accentuates its shape without dis­
tracting from it. The four-tone color palette showcases the harmony of restraint; 
it's a deconstruction without deconsecration.
