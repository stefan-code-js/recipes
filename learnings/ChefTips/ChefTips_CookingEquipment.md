(95°C) or lower and to hold foods at 140°F (60°C) for long periods. large cuts of meat take many 
hours to roast at a low temperature like 200°F (95°C). By setting the controls in advance, the operator can even let meats roast overnight, unattended.
these ovens are available as convection ovens and as regular stationary-air ovens.
Combination Steamer Ovens
the combination steamer oven, also called a combi oven, can be operated in three modes: as a 
convection oven, as a convection steamer (p. 48), and, with both functions on at once, as a high-
humidity oven. i njecting moisture into an oven while roasting meats can help reduce shrinkage 
and drying.
modern combi ovens are equipped with computerized controls than enable them to be 
programmed for multiple changes of temperature a
