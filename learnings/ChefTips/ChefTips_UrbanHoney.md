URBAN HONEY 
TATE DINING ROOM & BAR - VICKY LAU 
Chef Vicky Lau came up with the idea for this dish while searching for 
locally grown ingredients to use at Tate Dining Room & Bar, her Hong Kong restau­
rant. It was a challenging endeavor, given the urban landscape and high cost of real

she used for this collection of mignardises, or bite-sized desserts. Her ginger 
pastille, honey gateau, kumquat honey burst, white-chocolate honey crunch, and 
banana-caramel honey bonbon tell the sweet story of the ingredient's versatility 
and preciousness; their colorful, playful arrangement suggests a collection of jew­
els or a childhood treasure trove.
