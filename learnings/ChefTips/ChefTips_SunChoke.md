## The Insight

SUN CHOKE, 
WALNUT& 
CAVIAR 
28 Tl TRIN NED -
RAINER GASSNER 
"The masculine King of the Earth meets 
the feminine Queen of the Sea" is how chef Rainer 
Gassner describes this appetizer of sunchoke, 
walnut, and caviar that he serves at his restaurant 
Ti Trin Ned in Fredericia, Denmark. The dish is con­
sidered an autumn luxury, and presented as such: 
the simple plating, Gassner explains, is intended to 
showcase the ingredients "almost like pieces of 
jewellery-naked, without decoration." Caviar, 
arguably the most luxurious of the dish's compo­
nents, is the focal point here, aptly positioned in 
a way that recalls rare jewels in a display case. The 
simple layering of the ingredients also reinforces 
the dish's underlying promise: depths of flavor, left 
to speak clearly for themselves.
