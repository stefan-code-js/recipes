Tl TRIN NED -RAINER GASSNER 
The goal of this dish was simple, says Rainer Gassner, co-chef and 
co-owner of the Fredericia, Denmark restaurant Ti Trin Ned: to show that "one of 
our favorite vegetables can be served in many other ways than as a stew." That 
vegetable is rhubarb, and to best illustrate its versatility, Gassner chose to present 
it in three different ways: mousse, compote, and sorbet, leaving any other distrac­
tions off the plate. "The result is the stringent and almost arrogant plating," he says. 
The flavor stands out clearly, as do the colors, which are juxtaposed almost exactly 
as they are on the color wheel. Viewed against the white plate, the gradations make 
a compelling case for the vegetable; it is rhubarb narcissism at its best.
