fiber, but from a purely gastronomic point of view, using just 30 to 40 percent gives the
flavor and texture I like best. With this ratio, the final bread has good volume and a light,
open texture, along with the nuttiness and depth of flavor whole wheat provides.
In this recipe, the shaped loaves spend the night in the refrigerator rising very slowly;
this allows the dough to develop more of the complexity of flavors that come from an
extended, slow rise. We use this technique for much of the bread we bake at Ken’s
Artisan Bakery, especially our levain breads, but it works for straight doughs too, as
here. The schedule in this recipe makes it possible for you to bake the bread early the
next morning. Baking this bread is a very nice way to begin the day, perhaps on a Sunday
