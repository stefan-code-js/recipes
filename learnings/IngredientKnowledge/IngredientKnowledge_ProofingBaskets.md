## The Insight

$20.
Proofing Baskets
Proofing baskets are used to hold shaped loaves as they proof, or undergo their final
rise. Because all of the loaves in this book are baked in 4-quart Dutch 
ovens, you’ll only
need one size of proofing basket: 9 inches in diameter at the top and 3½ inches deep—or
whatever diameter matches the shape of your Dutch oven. If you can afford cane
banneton
 baskets, they will last a lifetime. Linen-lined proofing baskets are also a great
choice. The recipes in this book were tested with Frieling baskets. Matfer is another
respected brand. You can also improvise a proofing basket using a bowl of
approximately the same dimensions lined with a flour-dusted, lint-free tea towel.
Odds and Ends
You’ll obviously want a pair of 
oven mitts for dealing with hot Dutch ovens. Make sure
the mitts you buy are safe for handling a 500°F (260°C) pot. An 
oven thermometer also
comes in handy, since home ovens rarely deliver the exact temperature you dial in. Mine
runs about 25°F cooler
