to sneak any vegetable besides a carrot 
into him. | tried pureeing spinach into 
smoothies—nope. Tucking greens under 
the cheese in pizza—no way, with a side 
of dramatic gagging. 
One day | realized | had made green 
pasta dough using nettles plenty of times. 
Vegetable-dyed pasta has a centuries- 
old history in Italy, so why wasn’t | using 
other vegetables in my own noodles too? 
| banked on Bentley not being able 
to taste the vegetable ingredients, and 
| confess to telling the parental white 
lie that all the colors were edible Play-

vegetables in every color of the rainbow, 
he was also in the kitchen with me, 
playing with the dough and providing me 
with a lifetime of treasured mama-son 
memories. He eats vegetables like a boss 
now, no matter the form, and I’m happy 
| found a way to get him over the tiny 
hurdle without giving up and resorting to 
chicken nuggets on the regular. 
And my own obsessio
