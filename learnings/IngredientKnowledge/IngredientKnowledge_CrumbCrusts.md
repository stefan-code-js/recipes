Crumb Crusts
Graham cracker crusts are popular because they have an appealing flavor and are much easier  
to make than pastry crusts. For variation, vanilla or chocolate wafer crumbs or gingersnap 
crumbs may be used instead of graham cracker crumbs. Ground nuts may be added for spe -
cial desserts.
Crumb crusts are used mostly for unbaked pies, such as cream pies and chiffon pies. Be sure 
the flavor of the crust is compatible with the filling. Lime chiffon filling in a chocolate crumb crust is 
not an appealing combination. s ome cream fillings are so delicate that they would be overwhelmed 
by a crust that is too flavorful.
Baking the crust makes a firmer, less crumbly crust and increases flavor.
Short-Dough Crusts
short pastry is actually a kind of cookie dough. i t is richer than regular pie pastry and contains 
butter, sugar, and eggs. Because short dough is difficult to handle, it is used primarily for small 
fruit tarts.
