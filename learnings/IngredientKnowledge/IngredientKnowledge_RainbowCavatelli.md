## The Insight

RAINBOW CAVATELLI 
Please see the header in the Cavatelli recipe on page 108 for information on cavatelli 
boards, or what you can use in place of one to execute rainbow cavatelli. 
This recipe got me in a lot of trouble across the Internet. It was featured in a food 
video that got upward of thirty million views, and because of that, | received nearly as 
many opinions on these contentious little suckers. Among the main objections? “They 
look like gummy worms, Linda. You're trying to trick us into eating vegetable candy, and 
that isn’t cool.” Umm, sorry? “Food coloring is the devil, and there is no way you can 
make those colors without it, so you are the devil, Linda.” | hope this book is enough to 
refute that! And finally, “But they're so much work—no thanks!” That couldn't be further 
from the truth. They're among the easiest of shapes, in fact. Give them a go; you won't 
regret it. MAKES 4 SERVINGS 
SPECIAL EQUIPMENT 
A silicone sushi mat or a gnocchi board 
VY% batch Beet-Papr
