eggs
Forms
as we discussed in chapter 25, eggs are purchased in the following forms:
1. Whole shell eggs.
2. Frozen: whites, yolks, whole, and whole with extra yolks.
3. dried: whole, whites, yolks.
Functions
eggs perform the following functions in baking:
1. Structure.
like gluten protein, egg protein coagulates to give structure to baked products. this is 
especially important in high-ratio cakes, where the high sugar and fat content weakens the gluten.
if used in large quantities, eggs make baked products tough or chewy unless balanced by 
high fat and sugar, which are tenderizers.
2. Emulsification of fats.
egg yolks contain natural emulsifiers, which help produce smooth batters. this contributes to 
both volume and texture.
3. Leavening.
beaten eggs incorporate air in tiny cells or bubbles. i n a batter, this trapped air expands when 
heated and aids in leavening.
4. Shortening action.the fat in egg yolks acts as a shortening. this is an important function in produ
