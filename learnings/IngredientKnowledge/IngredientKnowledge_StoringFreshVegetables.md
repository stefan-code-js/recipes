## The Insight

Storing fresh vegetables 
All vegetables are made up of living cells and must be stored 
properly to keep them fre sh for as long as possible. Different 
vegetables require different storage conditions but, while 
refrigeration keeps many fresher for lon ger, not all need t o 
be chilled. Some keep best away from light, while other s 
dislike changes in temperature. The cri sper drawer in th e 
refrigerator, on the high-humidity settin g, is the best plac e 
for vegetables that wilt or lose moistur e easily. The low­
humidity sett ing is best for ethylene-producing vege tables, 
such as avocados. Clean the vegetable drawer frequently 
to eliminate microbes that could cause spoilage. As soon as 
vegetables are cut, they begin to discolor and lose nutrient s, 
so store them in an airtight container in the refrigerato r and 
use within 24 hours .
