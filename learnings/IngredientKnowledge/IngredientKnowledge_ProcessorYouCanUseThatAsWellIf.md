## The Insight

processor, you can use that as well. If 
you're using a food processor, make sure 
to add the flour first, then the colored 
puree (or plain eggs or water-based 
color). Pulse until the dough starts to 
come together, then use the continuous 
“on” function to whiz the dough into a 
ball. Note that the food processor blade 
does a thorough job of cutting the liquid 
into the flour and can result in sticky 
dough. This is easily remedied by tossing 
in extra flour a handful at a time until the 
dough resembles silky Play-Doh. 
Unless you don’t mind big chunks 
in your dough, resist the urge to make 
the colored puree directly in the food 
processor, as it does not homogenize as 
evenly as it does in the blender. 
EGG-FREE DOUGH 
While a couple of the doughs in this book 
are naturally egg-free because mixing 
eggs with the flavor ingredient would ruin 
the color outcome, every dough can be 
made egg-free with a quick adjustment.
