## The Insight

decompose. In many kitchens I’ve worked in, stockpots 
have bubbled on and on and the stocks have been 
ruined. I’ve knocked about an hour off the cooking 
time for veal stock and about half an hour off the 
time for chicken stock to stop the flavors getting 
lost through overcooking. I reduce sauces very rapidly 
because that’s the only way to keep the flavors fresh. 
I only put a few drops of cream or lemon juice into 
a sauce at a time because it’s important to taste and 
test each step of the way. You have to follow the 
development of a taste up the hill until it gets to the 
peak. Chuck too much in and you could send it 
over the other side without even being aware of the peak 
you've missed. 
Since I’m talking about principles, here’s another: 
be generous, be extravagant. Without generosity there’s 
no love, and without love there’s no understanding. 
A mean cook is a failed cook. I know I have to watch some INTRODUCTION 
ingredients like foie gras and truffles when I’m cooking
