## The Insight

A NOTE ON PIZZA DOUGH 
YIELDS
You might wonder why or whether you should make enough pizza dough to produce
five dough balls if you only want to make one or two pizzas. You can halve these
recipes and get the same results. You can also quintuple them! The ingredient ratios
remain the same regardless of batch size, but bigger batches are easier to mix in a
mixer than by hand.
I like having an extra dough ball or two on hand in case one breaks or tangles while
I’m shaping it or in case it doesn’t load into the oven well. One time my dog
grabbed a pizza just as I was about to put it in the oven, and a hilarious game of tug-
of-war ensued. (Why did I set the peel with a fully prepped pizza on the coffee
table at dog height?) If I end up with extra dough, I might use it to make a simple
focaccia topped with marinara or olive oil, salt, and pepper, which can be eaten
fresh or wrapped up and saved for the next day.
