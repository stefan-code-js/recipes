# Recipe Scaling and Large-Batch Control

## Scaling Formula

- **Conversion Factor** = new yield ÷ old yield.

- Multiply every ingredient by the conversion factor.

## Heat and Seasoning Adjustment

- **Cook Time**: For double batches, increase cook time slightly, but watch doneness cues, **not minutes**.

- **Spices and Salt**: Start at **80 %** of scaled amount, adjust at finish.

## Cooling Large Batches

- **HACCP**: Split into shallow pans.

- **Safety**: Never stack hot pans.
