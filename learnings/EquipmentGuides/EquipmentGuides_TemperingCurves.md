WHAT ARE THE MAIN TEMPERING METHODS?
In addition to the tabling method (the most widely used by professionals, see p. 572) and the water bath method (see 
p. 570) , the following methods can also be used to temper chocolate:
– Seeding: Melt two-thirds of the chocolate you wish to temper to 113°F (45°C). Gradually add in the 
remaining third in small pieces and stir until completely melted. Once the temperature has dropped to 
the lower pre-crystallization temperature for the type of chocolate you are using, reheat the chocolate to 90° F (32°C).
– Adding micronized cocoa butter (Mycryo):  Melt your chocolate until it reaches 95°F (3
