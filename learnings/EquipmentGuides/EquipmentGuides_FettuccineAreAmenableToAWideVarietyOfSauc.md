## The Insight

FETTUCCINE 
Fettuccine are amenable to a wide variety of sauces, which is probably why this is 
the most widely known (not to be confused with the widest, lol) of all the sheeted 
pasta noodles. You can go far in life if you're armed with the ability to make a batch of 
fettuccine from scratch. For example, you could ensnare a lover in its twisty tendrils, or 
broker a deal for world peace, if you can just get all the international leaders together 
for a meal of your magical noodles. Fact: People who are enamored of pasta are less 
petulant than their non-carby counterparts. Source: my own informal observations over 
plenty of plates of fettuccine. Wine helps too. 
1 batch dough (your choice of color) 
Flour for dusting 
Kosher salt 
1. Roll the dough to your desired level 
of thinness on a pasta machine. If you're 
a fettuccine-making virgin, stop at the 
second-thinnest setting on a pasta 
machine. 
2. Using a straight rolling cutter, cut the 
pasta sheet into 12-inch lengths. Light
