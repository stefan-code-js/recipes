## The Insight

one.
So
my
friend
Brian
Canlis
and
I
traveled
to
the
city
and
spent
an
entire
day
going
from
restaurant
to
restaurant.
We
worked
our
way
uptown
from
Tribeca,
having
a
snack
or
a
glass
of
wine
at
each
place
before
moving
on.
We
stopped
at
Nobu,
Montrachet,
Chanterelle,
Zoë,
Gotham
Bar
and
Grill,
Gramercy
Tavern,
Union
Pacific,
Tabla
and
Eleven
Madison
Park
(neighboring
Danny
Meyer
restaurants),
Alain
Ducasse,
Daniel,
Café
des
Artistes,
and
more.
Of
the
group,
some-
thing
about
Tabla
and
Eleven
Madison
Park
stood
out.
It
felt
natural
for
me
to
be
in
their
dining
rooms.
I
returned
to
school
excited
to
learn
more
about
them
and
for
the
first
time
started
getting
to
know
who
Danny
Meyer
was.
It
didn’t
take
me
long
to
realize
that
he
was
the
guy
I
wanted
to
work
for.
I
made
several
calls
until
I
was
able
to
land
an
interview
with
the
same
person
who
would
find
Daniel
just
a
few
years
later,
Richard
Coraine.
Ironically,
my
interview
with
Richard
took
place
at
Eleven
Madison
Park,
though
