## The Insight

STRIPED PACCHERI RIGATI 
The forming technique for paccheri is the same as that of cannelloni with one extra 
tiny step, so if you've already made cannelloni, you'll be an old pro at this. Not that I’m 
calling you old, because you're not. You're young, vibrant, and in need of some totally 
tubular rainbows in your life. 
Most packaged paccheri does not have ridges, and you're welcome to try to make 
these without the sushi mat for a smooth look. The sushi mat does prevent the pasta 
from sticking to the rolling dowel, however, so if you roll them smooth against a flat 
surface, be sure to use plenty of flour to avoid sticky frustration. 
| recommend reading the headnote for the cannelloni technique on page 135 if 
you haven't made them yet, to familiarize yourself with the equipment and process. 
SPECIAL EQUIPMENT 
A silicone sushi mat or a gnocchi board MAKES 4 SERVINGS 
1 rolling dowel, 7/s-inch diameter, 1 foot long 
2 or more drying dowels, 3/4-inch diameter, 4 feet long
