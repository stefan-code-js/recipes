# Training Drill: Consistency Drills

## Goal

Keep same results every time.

## Practice: Sauce Consistency

1. Choose one sauce (e.g., beurre blanc or reduction).

2. Have three cooks make it separately.

3. Weigh yield, taste, viscosity, salt %.

4. Compare results.

5. **Action**: Adjust written recipe so everyone lands on the same result.

## Practice: Yield Control

1. Weigh steak raw and again after cooking.

2. Note shrink %.

3. **Goal**: Find normal loss and spot when a batch was overcooked or old.
