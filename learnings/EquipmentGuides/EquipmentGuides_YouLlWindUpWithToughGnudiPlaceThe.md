## The Insight

you'll wind up with tough gnudi. Place the 
dough ball on the sheet pan and repeat 
to roll the rest of the dough. Strive for 
uniformity in size. If some are bigger or 
smaller, you will wind up with some that 
are mushy and overcooked and some 
that are liquidy inside. 
4. Cover the sheet pan and refrigerate 
immediately for at least 30 minutes so 
they have a chance to firm up. This pasta 
does not store well, so | recommend 
cooking within 3 hours. 
5. Bring a generous amount of salted 
water to a boil in a large pot over high 
heat and, in a large sauté pan over 
~ medium heat, heat the oil and the 
remaining 1/2 tablespoons butter. 6. Boil half of the gnudi until they float, 
3 to 5 minutes. Gently stir the gnudi 
occasionally with a wooden spoon to 
keep them from sticking to the bottom of 
the pot. Test the gnudi for doneness by 
removing one with a slotted spoon and 
cutting it in half. If it looks (and tastes) 
cooked through, they are done. Repeat 
with the remaining gnudi.
