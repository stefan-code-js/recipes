## Step-by-Step Instructions

1. Chestnut Ice Cream Sandwich 
Chestnuts and water are blended and the liquid strained

2. This chestnut 
milk is then reduced for up to two days until thick, then further reduced 
until it begins to caramelize and thicken

3. The mixture is beaten in a 
mortar and pestle to smooth and aerate the texture of the mochi

4. The 
chestnut mochi is flattened into a thin sheet using a pasta roller and 
then a black currant leaf is pressed onto the surface so the mochi takes 
on the impression of the veining from the leaf

5. The edges are trimmed 
into a leaf shape

6. To build the ice cream sandwich, chestnut praline is piped around 
the perimeter of one mochi leaf in successive rounds to build up a 
border

7. A fine layer of milk ice cream is piped over the uncovered 
surface of the leaf, followed by a layer of blueberry reduction

8. Semi­
dried black currants and black currant shoots are placed on top, 
followed by another layer of milk ice cream

9. A �econd mochi leaf is 
gently pressed on top, using a final piping of chestnut praline so the two 
leaves adhere and enclose the fillings

10. To finish, the ice cream sandwich 
is quickly torched to soften its appearance, brushed with black currant 
wood oil, and nestled among real leaves
