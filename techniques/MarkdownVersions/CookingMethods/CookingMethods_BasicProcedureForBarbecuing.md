## Step-by-Step Instructions

1. Collect all equipment and food supplies.

2. Prepare or trim the item. Heavy fat coverings on meat should be trimmed to about ½ inch

3. If using a rub, prepare the spice mixture. Coat the meat items evenly on all sides with the rub (Fig. 15.4). Cover and refrigerate for 24 hours.

4. Before cooking, remove the items to be barbecued from the refrigerator and let stand at room temperature for about 1 hour.

5. Select the desired hardwood (choices include hickory, mesquite, pecan, and fruit tree woods such as apple and cherry) and prepare it according the instructions for your equipment.

6. Preheat the smoking equipment to the desired temperature (200°–250°F or 93°–120°C is a typical temperature range for low-temperature barbecuing).

7. Arrange the meats or other items on racks in the smoker. Allow enough space between items to permit the smoke to circulate well and contact all surface areas.

8. If a mop is used (see sidebar, p. 419), baste the items with the liquid at intervals during the cooking period. Note that a mop is not the same as a barbecue sauce. Unlike barbecue sauces, mops contain no sugar, which would burn too easily.

9. Barbecue until the items are tender. For items containing bones, the bones should easily pull free from the meat. Total time can range from a few hours for tender items to more than 10 or 12 hours for whole pork shoulder or beef brisket cooked at the low end of the temperature range.

10. Barbecue sauces may be used to glaze items such as spareribs and brisket. Apply the sauce to the items and return the meat to the smoker to dry out the sauce or, alternatively, place the ribs in a broiler or on a grill just long enough to lightly brown the sauce. Do not allow the sauce to burn.

11. Evaluate the finished product (p. 427).
