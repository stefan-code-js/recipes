## Step-by-Step Instructions

1. 9 I had barely announced the decision to close Noma 
and rebuild it in a derelict corner of Copenhagen when 
I was seized by doubt

2. There was plenty that I hadn't 
thought through, like where to find the money, or how 
to transplant a restaurant without losing the hard-won 
trust of our guests

3. But the question that did terrify 
me, as I surveyed the graffiti-covered patch of land that 
would become our new home, was this: What if we move 
here and do things exactly like we did them before

4. This book is about the new Noma, its people and
spaces and, of course, the food

5. But it's also about 
the invisible structures we set up to sustain creativity,
innovation, and surprise

6. Part of what drove this move
was the determination not to let previous success poison
our creative minds

7. The need to rekindle our appetite for
new things

8. The urge to stay alert to fresh opportunities

9. From the architecture to the seasonality of our menus,
everything at the new Noma helps keep our minds open
