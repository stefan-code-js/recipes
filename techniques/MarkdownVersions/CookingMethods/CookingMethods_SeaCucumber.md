## Overview

Sea Cucumber 
Sea cucumbers are cleaned and butchered to remove their gonads 
and produce an even sheet of flesh; the gonads are reserved. The flesh 
is dried until crisp and then deep-fried until puffed but still flat. The 
gonads are also dried until caramelized and sweet. 
Ice-clarified mussel juice is reduced until viscous, then spread into a 
thin layer and dried until the mussel caramel is completely crisp. 
Whipped cream is dolloped in a serving bowl and seasoned with 
roasted kelp salt.
