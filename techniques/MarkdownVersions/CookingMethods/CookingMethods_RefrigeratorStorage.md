## Step-by-Step Instructions

1. Keep all perishable foods properly refrigerated. note the lower limit of the food danger Zone

2. do not crowd refrigerators. Leave space between items so cold air can circulate.

3. Keep refrigerator doors shut except when removing or putting in foods.

4. Keep shelves and interiors of refrigerators clean.

5. store raw and cooked items separately, if possible.

6. if raw and cooked foods must be kept in the same refrigerator, keep cooked foods above raw foods. if cooked foods are kept below raw foods, they can become contaminated by drips and spills. then, if they are not to be cooked again before serving, they may be hazardous.

7. Keep refrigerated foods wrapped or covered and in sanitary containers.

8. do not let any unsanitary surface, such as the bottoms of other containers, touch any food.

9. Chill foods as quickly as possible over ice or in a cold-water bath before placing in the refriger-

10. When holding foods such as protein salads in a cold bain-marie or refrigerated table for service, do not heap the food above the level of the container. the food above this level will not stay cold enough.

11. to keep foods hot for service, use steam tables or other equipment that will keep all parts of all

12. Keep foods covered.

13. Bring foods to holding temperature as quickly as possible by using ovens, steamers, rangetop pots and pans, or other cooking equipment. do not warm cold foods by placing them directly in the steam table. they will take too long to heat, and bacteria will have time to grow.

14. do not let ready-to-eat foods come in contact with any contaminated surface.
