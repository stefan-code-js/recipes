## Step-by-Step Instructions

1. TARTINE BREAD
28Continuing my focus on bread, I drew on the traditional bread-making discipline 
I had learned during my apprenticeship in the Berkshires and in France—while 
still searching for the loaf with an old soul

2. In France, I had fallen in love with the sweet, creamy flavor of bread fer -
mented with wild yeast leaven that contradicts the widespread perception of “sour -
dough.” I wanted anything but sour bread

3. I wanted a deep auburn crust to shatter 
between the teeth, giving way to tender, pearlescent crumb

4. I wanted my baker’s 
signature, the score made with a blade on top, to rise and fissure, and the crust to

6. To gain a following for these large, crusty loaves, I 
would make sure to bring bread that was still warm from the oven to the markets

7. I began by doing things the way I had learned, but my present circum -
stances were different and required adjustments

8. Kneading hun -
dreds of pounds of dough daily by hand might have been an impossible task for 
a lone baker, but the wet dough was comparatively easy to develop by hand

9. I 
“kneaded” the dough in buckets by gently folding it at regular intervals
