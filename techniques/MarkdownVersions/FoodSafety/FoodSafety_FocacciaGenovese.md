## Overview

FOCACCIA GENOVESE
The soulful home of focaccia is along the Ligurian coast of Italy. Genoa is the capital of
Liguria, and focaccia Genovese is a staple of the local cuisine. Traditionally, it’s made
from a very soft dough, spread out in rectangular or round pans and dimpled by the
baker’s fingers in the process of working olive oil into the dough. After being baked to a
golden hue, it’s sometimes topped with more olive oil and a sprinkling of salt.
