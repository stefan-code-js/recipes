temperature. When you’ve mixed your final dough and are about to cover it for
rising, or bulk fermentation, take a temperature reading with a probe thermometer. If
the dough doesn’t fall between 75ºF and 80ºF (24ºC and 27ºC), you should make
adjustments next time.
To control the 
temperature of the mixed dough, you need to work with four
variables: water temperature, flour temperature, room temperature, and the length of
the autolyse (pronounced “auto-lease”). The easiest variable to manipulate

## Step-by-Step Instructions

1. When you’ve mixed your final dough and are about to cover it for
rising, or bulk fermentation, take a temperature reading with a probe thermometer

2. If
the dough doesn’t fall between 75ºF and 80ºF (24ºC and 27ºC), you should make
adjustments next time

3. To control the 
temperature of the mixed dough, you need to work with four
variables: water temperature, flour temperature, room temperature, and the length of
the autolyse (pronounced “auto-lease”)

4. The easiest variable to manipulate is the
water temperature, and I’ll give you some guidelines about using warmer or cooler
water

5. If you pay attention to your results (and keep notes), after a couple of
attempts you should be able to figure out the ideal water temperature for mixing
your dough

6. Most of the recipes in this book specify a target temperature of 78ºF (26ºC) for the
final mixed dough

7. I consider this to be the sweet spot, but I encourage you to
experiment with different temperatures between 75ºF and 80ºF (24ºC and 27ºC)

8. The only way to find the optimum combination of time and temperature that gives
the best flavor and volume in a given recipe is to repeat and adjust based on what
you did last time

9. It’s part of the fun of baking
