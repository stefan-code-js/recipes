## Overview

BASIC COUNTRY BREAD
77The Final Rise
The final rising time is variable. At warm proofing temperatures around 80°F, 
loaves will be ready to bake in 3 to 4 hours. If you don’t retard the final rising, 
your bread will have little to no perceptible sour flavor, and the flavor of the 
wheat will be more up-front. You still gain the benefits of sourdough: your bread 
will stay fresh longer, and it will have a more complex savor.

## Step-by-Step Instructions

1. BASIC COUNTRY BREAD
77The Final Rise
The final rising time is variable

2. At warm proofing temperatures around 80°F, 
loaves will be ready to bake in 3 to 4 hours

3. If you don’t retard the final rising, 
your bread will have little to no perceptible sour flavor, and the flavor of the 
wheat will be more up-front

4. You still gain the benefits of sourdough: your bread 
will stay fresh longer, and it will have a more complex savor

5. Retarding, or slowing, the final rise by cooling the loaves and holding 
them in the refrigerator enables you to control two key things: when you bake your 
bread, and the intensity of the flavors

6. During a longer final rise, flavors gained 
from fermentation build to an optimal intensity and then become increasingly sour

7. So you have a wide range to work with

8. You can make delicately flavored 
bread that no one would think to call sourdough, or you can make substantially 
stronger-flavored bread to your taste

9. The Bake
This is the final act in producing your bread

10. I began baking with a gas-fired 
hearth deck oven during my apprenticeship with Richard Bourdon
