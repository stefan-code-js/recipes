1. Use the same three-compartment sink setup and procedure as for manual dishwashing.
2. do not use scouring powder or steel wool. these may make scratches where bacteria can hide. 
also, pieces of steel wool break off and can remain in the pan and thus get into food.
3. Utensils with baked-on foods should be scraped and rinsed, soaked in the first compartment to loosen the baked-on food, and then scraped and rinsed again
