When retarding the dough in this way, beware of any temptation to move on to the
next step before the dough is fully evolved. As with adjusting hydration, it’s helpful
to be familiar with the recipe so you’ll be able to recognize when the dough is
optimally fermented or proofed. With experience, you’ll learn to judge by its
appearance.

## Step-by-Step Instructions

1. awhile for the dough to chill, so it will continue to evolve in the cooler
temperatures

2. When retarding the dough in this way, beware of any temptation to move on to the
next step before the dough is fully evolved

3. As with adjusting hydration, it’s helpful
to be familiar with the recipe so you’ll be able to recognize when the dough is
optimally fermented or proofed

4. With experience, you’ll learn to judge by its
appearance

5. My overall guidance is that you can elongate the process by refrigerating the
dough or holding it at cooler temperatures during bulk fermentation and proofing

6. With practice you’ll learn how to do this and still get excellent (sometimes
improved) results

7. Just be careful not to use dough that isn’t fully fermented or
proofed when you move on to the next stage, because you’ll sacrifice flavor and
volume in the baked bread

8. On the flip side, there are always going to be times when your dough is moving
too slow—this is often a problem in the wintertime

9. If you have a dough that is
supposed to triple in size in five hours but hasn’t, or an overnight dough that
doubled when it should have increased in volume at least two and a half times, find
a warm spot to speed up the dough

10. The most convenient place I’ve found is in my
oven—with the door ajar and the oven light on, it’s just the right temperature
