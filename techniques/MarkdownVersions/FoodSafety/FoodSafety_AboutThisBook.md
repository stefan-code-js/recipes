## Overview

ABOUT THIS BOOK
I was fortunate to train with many excellent bakers in the United States plus two in
France during the two-year between-careers period before I opened my own bakeshop in
Portland. What struck me during my professional baking training was that the most
important lessons I was learning—how to use long fermentation, pre-ferments, autolyse,
and temperature management, for example—were not discussed in any of the bread
books I had read. I later encountered books that did detail these

## Step-by-Step Instructions

1. ABOUT THIS BOOK
I was fortunate to train with many excellent bakers in the United States plus two in
France during the two-year between-careers period before I opened my own bakeshop in
Portland

2. What struck me during my professional baking training was that the most
important lessons I was learning—how to use long fermentation, pre-ferments, autolyse,
and temperature management, for example—were not discussed in any of the bread
books I had read

3. I later encountered books that did detail these things (like those by
Raymond Calvel and 
Michel Suas), but they were targeted to the professional

4. I was sure
that the techniques I had learned could apply to the home baker too

5. In the years that followed the opening of Ken’s Artisan Bakery, several notable baking
books were published

6. But I still saw an opportunity to address the techniques used in a
good artisan bakery and how they could be adopted for the home kitchen

7. I wanted to
write a book that didn’t totally dumb down these techniques, since the concepts really
aren’t that difficult for the nonprofessional baker to apply

8. And I wanted to break from
the mold prevalent in almost every bread book out there (at least until very recently): that
every recipe had to use a rise time of just one to two hours

9. Further, I was completely
motivated to demonstrate how good bread can be when it’s made from just the four
principle ingredients: flour, water, salt, and yeast
