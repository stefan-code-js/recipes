BASIC PRINCIPLES of Coffee Making
Coffee is made by extracting flavors from ground coffee beans by 
dissolving them in hot water. The essence of making good coffee is to extract enough of these solids to make a flavorful beverage, but not to brew so long as to extract those solids that make the coffee bitter.
With this principle in mind, study the following guidelines 
for making good coffee. The list is long, and every item is important.

## Step-by-Step Instructions

1. Use fresh coffee. Once it is ground, coffee loses flavor and aroma rapidly. To maintain freshness, store coffee, tightly sealed, in a cool, dry place. Even with the best storage, however, you should not use coffee more than a week old. Vacuum-packed coffee keeps longer, but it too deteriorates as soon as it is opened. If you can’t grind your own coffee (some restaurants do), at least you can arrange for frequent delivery.

2. Use the right grind and the right brewing time.

3. Use the right proportions.

4. Use fresh water.

5. Use water at the right brewing temperature: 195°−200°F (90°−93°C). Water that is too hot extracts bitter solids. Water that is too cold does not extract enough flavor and yields coffee that is too cool for serving.6. Use a good brewing procedure.  Most operations use either urns, for large volume, or automatic drip makers, which make one pot at a time, as shown in the photograph. These machines can make excel-lent coffee because water passes through the grounds only once.

6. Use clean equipment. Urns and coffee makers must be cleaned every day. Coffee leaves oily deposits that quickly turn rancid or bitter and can ruin the next batch of coffee.

7. Use good filters. Good filters are the only way to ensure sparkling, clear coffee. Most operations use paper filters, which are dis-carded after use. If cloth filters are used, they must be per-fectly clean and free from odors.

8. Use proper holding procedures.
