## Overview

The levain recipes in this book assume you have a mature levain culture. If you’re going
to bake with your levain several days each week, you’ll want to have a daily routine for
feeding the levain. You can do it each morning, ideally at about the same time, but it can
vary by an hour or two in either direction without causing problems. When it’s time to
feed the levain, use the following formula:
• 100 grams (⅓ cup + 1½ tablespoons) of levain (or a little more in winter; see
