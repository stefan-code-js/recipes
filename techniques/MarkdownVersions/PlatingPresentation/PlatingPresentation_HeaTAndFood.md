## Overview

Hea T and  food 113
as sugar is heated, its molecules break down into many new compounds. These compounds, in 
combination, have the typical flavor and brown color of caramel. The more the sugar is heated, the 
more the compounds break down, resulting in a darker color and a bitter flavor. Heavily caramelized 
sugar is less sweet than lightly caramelized sugar, because more of the sugar molecules are destroyed.

## Step-by-Step Instructions

1. Hea T and  food 113
as sugar is heated, its molecules break down into many new compounds

2. These compounds, in 
combination, have the typical flavor and brown color of caramel

3. The more the sugar is heated, the 
more the compounds break down, resulting in a darker color and a bitter flavor

4. Heavily caramelized 
sugar is less sweet than lightly caramelized sugar, because more of the sugar molecules are destroyed

5. Gelatinization
starches are important to cooks because of their function as thickeners for sauces and other liq-
uids, and they are important to bakers because they supply most of the bulk of breads and other 
baked goods

6. as described in the sidebar, starch molecules consist of long chains

7. i n their raw form, these 
molecules are packed into tiny bundles called starch granules

8. These granules change form in the presence of water and heat

9. To demonstrate how starches behave when heated, first mix a little cornstarch with cold water 
and let it stand

10. You will see that the starch settles to the bottom
