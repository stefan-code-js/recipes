## Step-by-Step Instructions

1. Black Fruits and Vegetables

2. The contemporary popularization of black garlic is credited to a man named Scott Kim, who devised a simple method for making black garlic using heat- and humidity-controlled aging chambers. We use the exact same methods at Noma to maintain an environment that leads to a cascade of slow chemical reactions, completely transforming ordinary ingredients over the course of weeks or months.

3. Vacuum-seal the garlic in vacuum bags.

4. Alternatively, wrap the garlic in two layers of foil.

5. Garlic ready for blackening.

6. Place the garlic into your rice cooker or fermentation chamber.

7. Close the chamber and set it to 60°C/140°F, or seal the cooker and set to “keep warm.”

8. The garlic will take 6 to 8 weeks to blacken.
