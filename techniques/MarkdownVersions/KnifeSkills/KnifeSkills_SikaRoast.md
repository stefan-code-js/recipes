## Overview

Sika Roast 
Wild deer scraps and bones are deeply roasted and then simmered 
with kelp and black peppercorns to make a stock. The stock is reduced 
to a glaze. Mushroom-kelp broth and truffle juice are reduced to make 
a sauce and finished with brown butter and chopped black truffles. 
The wild deer is grilled over hot charcoal while being brushed 
with the deer glaze, then carved into portions and served with the 
truffle sauce.
