PROCEDURE for Preparing White Stocks
1. Cut the bones into pieces, 3–4 inches (8–10 cm) long. 
This exposes more surface area and helps extraction. A meat saw is used to cut heavy veal and beef bones. Fish and chicken bones don’t need to be cut, but whole carcasses should be chopped for more convenient handling.
2. Rinse the bones in cold water. (If desired, chicken, veal, or beef bones may be blanched.) This removes some impurities that cloud the stock or, if the bones are old, g

## Step-by-Step Instructions

1. Cut the bones into pieces, 3–4 inches (8–10 cm) long.

2. Rinse the bones in cold water. (If desired, chicken, veal, or beef bones may be blanched.) This removes some impurities that cloud the stock or, if the bones are old, give an off taste.

3. Place the bones in a stockpot or steam-jacketed kettle and add cold water to cover. Starting in cold water speeds extraction (Fig. 8.4a). Starting in hot water delays it because many proteins are soluble in cold water but not in hot.

4. Bring water to a boil, and then reduce to a simmer. Skim the scum that comes to the surface, using a skimmer or perforated spoon. Skimming is important for a clear stock because the scum (which is fat and coagulated pro-tein) will cloud the stock if it is broken up and mixed back into the liquid.

5. Add the chopped mirepoix and the herbs and spices. Remember, the size to which you cut mirepoix depends on how long it is to be cooked.

6. Do not let the stock boil. Keep it at a low simmer. Boiling makes the stock cloudy because it breaks solids into tiny particles that get mixed into the liquid.

7. Skim the surface as often as necessary during cooking.

8. Keep the water level above the bones. Add more water if the stock reduces below this level. Bones cooked while exposed to air will turn dark and thus darken or discolor the stock. Also, they do not release flavor into the water if the water doesn’t touch them.

9. Simmer for the recommended length of time:

10. Skim the surface and strain off the stock through a china cap lined with several layers of cheesecloth. Adding a little cold water to the stock before skimming stops the cooking and brings more fat and impurities to the surface. To keep the stock as clear as possible, ladle rather than pour the stock into the china cap to avoid stirring up sediment and other fine particles.

11. Cool the stock as quickly as possible, as follows:

12. 12. Evaluate the quality of the finished stock (p. 170).

13. When cool, refrigerate the stock in covered containers. Stock will keep 2–3 days if properly refrigerated. Stock can also be
