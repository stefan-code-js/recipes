5. Rinse, soak, and steam the pearl barley until it’s fully cooked.

6. Break up the grains and allow them to cool to room temperature, then inoculate them with koji spores.

7. Place the inoculated grains in a fermentation chamber, ideally held at 30°C/86°F and 70% to 75% humidity.

8. Allow the koji to grow for 24 hours. Use gloved hands to turn the grains and furrow them into three rows for better heat dissipation.

9. Give the koji another 18 to 24 hours to finish growing. It will continue to grow, but you want to harvest it before the fungus goes to spore.

15. Let the barley cool to at least 30°C/86°F.

17. After 24 hours, you should begin to see the signs of mycelial growth. Mix the barley and furrow into three mounds.

18. After 48 hours, the koji should be fully grown.

19. Cool the barley in the refrigerator to stop the fungus’s growth. Pack in airtight containers and store in the refrigerator or freezer.

20. Measure out twice the koji’s weight in water (about 2.2 kilograms) and blend the two together in a blender at high speed for 1 minute; work in multiple batches, if necessary. Transfer the blended mixture to a freezer-safe container with a lid or heavy-duty zip-top bags, leaving enough room for the mixture to expand as it solidifies. Place in the freezer.
