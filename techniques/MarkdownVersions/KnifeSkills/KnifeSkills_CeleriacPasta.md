## Overview

Celeriac Pasta 
Celeriac is thinly sliced into large sheets, which are cooked, then 
brushed with koji-dashi reduction and oven-dried. The sheets are then 
brushed with egg yolk sauce, air-dried, and cut into squares. 
The celeriac squares are blanched in butter emulsion to soften, lined 
with oyster leaves, seasoned with roasted kelp salt spice mix, and rolled 
into garganelli shapes. The "pasta" rolls are served with whipped cream 
and more roasted kelp salt spice mix.
