## Overview

ZUCCHINI FOCACCIA
This recipe is one of my favorites in the summertime and early autumn, when garden-
fresh zucchini is abundant. Thinly sliced disks of zucchini are spread out across the
dough and resemble fish scales if you stand back and squint. Don’t use the softball bat–
sized zucchinis from your Aunt Zelda’s garden for this; use zucchini that’s just a couple
of inches in diameter. This focaccia looks cool if the dough is shaped into a freeform
oblong on a sheet pan.
