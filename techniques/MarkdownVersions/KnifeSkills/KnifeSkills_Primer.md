## Step-by-Step Instructions

1. Many ferments in this book begin with salt concentrations lower than 5 percent and a pH above 4.6. However, the combined effect of moderate salt content and a gradually decreasing pH is usually enough to safeguard against malevolent bacteria. For instance, a vegetable brined at 2 percent salt will have a high enough salt content to inhibit

2. When hydrogen ions outnumber hydroxide ions, the substance is acidic, and has a pH below 7. The most acidic substances you can find, like hydrochloric acid (a component of stomach acid) and sulphuric acid (found in car batteries), have a pH near 0. The most basic substances, like sodium hydroxide (found in lye or drain cleaner) have a pH close to 14.

3. Assemble the speed rack and slide one or two sheet pans into the lower shelves. Space them to allow enough room for your heater, humidifier, and hygrometer or humidistat (and fan, if the heater doesn’t have one built in) to sit without interfering with one another. Place the devices on a sheet pan and snake the cords out from the bottom of the rack.

4. You’ll want to keep your temperature controller outside the chamber. Plug it in and set it to the correct temperature, following the manufacturer’s instructions; for the ferments in this book, that will be either 30°C/86°F or 60°C/140°F. Run the temperature probe into the chamber. Plug the heater into the temperature controller.

5. Arrange the hygrometer or humidistat sensor so it won’t be in the direct flow of the steam from the humidifier. Fill the humidifier with water, plug it in, and set it to medium. Note that we’re clearly dealing with a lot of electrical cords, so use a properly rated power strip.

6. Pull the plastic cover over the speed rack and zip it up. Air will be able to enter the chamber from the bottom, which is what you need for most of the ferments. When fermenting at 60°C/140°F, you may want to add an extra layer of insulation underneath or on top of the plastic cover. A clean cotton or wool blanket will do the trick nicely.

7. Close the cover to bring your chamber up to the desired temperature and humidity. If you don’t have a humidistat, you’ll adjust humidity by checking the level on your hygrometer and then dialing the humidifier setting up or down. The temperature controller will take care of temperature for you.

8. Add your ferments. Keep an eye on the temperature controller to make sure it’s turning the heater on and off when the temperature dips or rises. You may see a drift of a degree or two above or below your desired temperature; that’s normal.

9. Ensure that your Styrofoam cooler is cleaned and sanitized. If you’re making koji, procure four screws that are long enough and sturdy enough to bear the weight of a tray of koji and screw them into the sides of the container, about halfway up the walls.

10. Place the heating mat and humidifier inside the container. Try to keep the humidifier off the heating mat, and snake the cords out of the box. Set the humidifier to medium and turn it on. Place your hygrometer (if you have one) next to the humidifier (out of the direct flow of steam) to keep track of the humidity.

11. Plug the heating mat into your temperature controller and, following the manufacturer’s instructions, set it to your desired target temperature; for the ferments in this book, that will be either 30°C/86°F or 60°C/140°F. Run the temperature probe into the chamber.

12. Bring your chamber up to the desired temperature and humidity. If you don’t have a humidistat, you’ll adjust humidity by checking the level on your hygrometer and then dialing the humidifier setting up or down. The temperature controller will take care of temperature for you.

13. Add your ferment(s). Keep an eye on the temperature controller to make sure it’s turning the heater on and off when the temperature dips or rises. You may see a drift of a degree or two above or below your desired temperature; that’s normal.

14. Cover the fermentation chamber with its lid. For ferments at 60°C/140°F, close it as tightly as you can to keep heat in. For koji, leave it cracked open on one side just a touch to allow fresh oxygen in. You can easily prop it open more with a screw placed into the lip if you’re worried about it being closed shut.
