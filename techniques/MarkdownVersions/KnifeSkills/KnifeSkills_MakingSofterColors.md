same for each one, and usually involves 
making a puree of eggs mixed with a 
colorful ingredient (except the few water-

such, most of the colors are strong, pure 
versions of themselves

3. If you wanted 
to make pastels or other softer colors, 
you can easily do that by adding less 
of the flavor ingredient

4. For example, 
the Red Beet Dough on page 39 calls for 1 medium beet

5. If you wanted a pale pink, 
you could add 2 tablespoons chopped 
beet instead

6. To determine the final 
dough color outcome, look at the shade 
of the puree after you've blended it

7. The dough will most closely resemble 
the color of the puree, so if you want it 
lighter or darker, add less or more of the 
flavor ingredient
