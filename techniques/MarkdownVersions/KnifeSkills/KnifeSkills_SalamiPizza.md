## Overview

SALAMI PIZZA
This is the cured meat lover’s pizza, essentially a Margherita pizza with the addition of
the salami of your choice. At 
Ken’s Artisan Pizza, we have two of these pizzas on our
menu: one with a spicy 
soppressata
 and another with 
finocchiona
, made by Olympic
Provisions, a local 
salumeria
 making admirable dry-cured sausages. In each case we
peel the salami, then slice it into thin disks—about 
1
/
16
 inch thick for the 
soppressata
 and
about ⅛ inch thick for the 
finocchiona
.

2. At 
Ken’s Artisan Pizza, we have two of these pizzas on our

finocchiona

4. I love the way the meat crisps as it bakes on top
of the pizza

5. The more salami you pile on the pizza, the thinner it should be sliced

6. My
preference is to not overwhelm the other ingredients on the pizza with too much meat;
rather, use it as an accent

7. Salumi
 refers to the entire range of cured meat products, typically
made from pork (but sometimes from beef), from ham and other salt-cured whole
muscles of meat to sausages, including cooked meat emulsions in casings, like
mortadella

8. Salami
 refers to a specific type of 
salumi
: dry-cured sausage, usually made
from pork, which may be either fresh or aged

9. Use whatever type of salami you prefer,
from pepperoni (an American invention usually made with beef, or with beef and pork)
to chorizo, 
saucisson sec
 to Genovese
