## Overview

DOUBLE-FED SWEET LEVAIN BREAD
This bread involves feeding the levain two times, just a few hours apart, before mixing
the final dough, a technique that I learned from 
Chad Robertson of 
Tartine Bakery when I
was learning to be a baker. The idea is to build up an active population of yeast in the
levain culture with two feedings using very warm water, in a way that limits the buildup
of sour flavors. You may notice a larger amount of levain here than in the other bread

## Step-by-Step Instructions

1. DOUBLE-FED SWEET LEVAIN BREAD
This bread involves feeding the levain two times, just a few hours apart, before mixing
the final dough, a technique that I learned from 
Chad Robertson of 
Tartine Bakery when I
was learning to be a baker

2. The idea is to build up an active population of yeast in the
levain culture with two feedings using very warm water, in a way that limits the buildup
of sour flavors

3. You may notice a larger amount of levain here than in the other bread
recipes in this book, the reason being that this levain is less active at the time I introduce
it into the dough mix

4. A long, slow fermentation, followed by retarding the loaves
overnight in the refrigerator, creates a bread with an excellent, sweetish levain flavor

5. The first time I baked this bread in my home kitchen, I thought, “Oh yeah, this is really
good.” It has a slight musky levain odor to its crumb and a gentle warmth of fermentation
flavors that I find very pleasant, especially in the crusty slices

6. When you are ready to mix the final dough, I recommend sticking your nose in the
levain bucket and taking in a big, deep draft of its odor

7. Almost, but not
quite, kind of like beer, with a slight edge of sour wheat

8. I wish I had the words

9. THIS RECIPE MAKES 2 LOAVES, EACH ABOUT 1½ POUNDS
