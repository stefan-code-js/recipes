A Historic Brew Reimagined
Kombucha was born in ancient China.
When we first began dedicating time and attention to learning about fermentation at Noma, we consumed every piece of relevant literature we could get our hands on. Each time we came across an unfamiliar term in a book, it gave us a thrill. The things we were reading about may have been centuries old, bu

## Step-by-Step Instructions

1. First make a juice, tea, or infusion. Sweeten it and cool it.

2. Add a SCOBY, or a cutting from one. A piece that covers at least 25 percent of the surface of the liquid should suffice.

3. Cover the container and leave the mixture to ferment, ideally at slightly warmer than room temperature.

4. Taste the kombucha often. Once it’s reached your ideal balance of sweetness and acidity, remove the SCOBY and reserve it, then strain and chill the kombucha.

5. Fermentation further increases the acidity to between 4 and 3.5. If you’re equipped and inclined, keep track of your kombucha’s progress and measure the pH and sugar content of the final product so it’s easier to replicate.

6. Water, SCOBY, lemon verbena, sugar, and finished kombucha.

7. Make a syrup using the sugar and an equal weight of water.

8. Combine the syrup and lemon verbena and allow to steep before adding the remaining water.

9. Strain the infusion through a fine-mesh sieve into the clean fermentation vessel.

10. Backslop with the unpasteurized kombucha.

11. Place the SCOBY into the fermentation vessel and cover.

12. Measure the sugar content using a refractometer (optional) and check again after 7 days.

13. Use pH strips to check the acidity of the kombucha. When the pH has reached 3.5 to 4, the kombucha should be close to ready.

14. Remove the SCOBY. Strain and bottle the kombucha.
