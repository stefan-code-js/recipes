## Overview

WALNUT LEVAIN BREAD
At Ken’s Artisan Bakery, we’ve been making walnut bread in various shapes and sizes
since the bakery opened, from loaves to big rounds to crusty, hearty walnut rolls that
people mostly buy for breakfast. We lightly roast the walnuts before adding them to the
dough. The bread is delicious on its own and is sublime when toasted and slathered with
butter and honey. We deliver torpedoes of our walnut bread to some restaurants who
then slice it, grill it, and pair it with cheese.
