## Step-by-Step Instructions

1. Chill the food to be coated. For best results, the surface of the item should be as smooth and as free of fat

2. Place the item on a wire rack over a tray or sheet pan. Excess aspic that falls onto the tray can be remelted and reused.

3. Cool the aspic jelly according to the procedure above.

4. Use the aspic as soon as it is ready. Various methods can be used to coat foods with aspic, depending on the size and shape of the item.

5. Working too slowly may produce an uneven, bumpy coat.

6. Chill the items until the jelly is thoroughly set.

7. Repeat with additional coats, if necessary, until the aspic is of the desired thickness.

8. To decorate, dip pieces of decoration in liquid aspic and place on the product in the desired pattern. Some items appropriate to use for decorating aspic are

9. If decorations are used, cover the decorated item with a final layer of aspic jelly to protect the design.

10. Evaluate the quality of the finished item (p. 862).

11. If the jelly is congealed, it must first be melted. Set the pan or container of jelly in a hot-water bath. Stir it gently from time to time until it is completely melted.

12. Place the warm aspic jelly in a stainless-steel bowl.

13. At all times, be careful not to make any bubbles. Bubbles in the jelly may get transferred to the surface of your food item and mar its appearance.

14. Select a ladle that fits the curve of the bowl. Set the bowl in crushed ice, pushing it in so it sits in a well of ice. With the edge of the ladle against the inside of the bowl, rotate the bowl so the ladle continually scrapes the inside of the bowl. This method prevents the formation of lumps that occur when jelly touching the cold bowl solidifies too quickly.

15. Continue to rotate the bowl until the jelly is thick and syrupy but not yet set. The jelly is now ready for use. Remove from the ice bath and work quickly, because it will set very fast.

16. Remelt and recool the jelly as necessary.
