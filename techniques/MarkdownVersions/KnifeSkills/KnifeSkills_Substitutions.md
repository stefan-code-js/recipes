## Step-by-Step Instructions

1. SUBSTITUTIONS 
If | call for a particular cheese, cured 
meat, or type of tomato, | do so for a 
reason, but that’s no reason for you to 
not make the recipe just because you 
can't find it or maybe don't like it

2. Tweak 
these sauce recipes with what you can 
find and what you like

3. That being said, if | specify ground 
pork and you slide in eggplant, your 
sauce is going to have some structural 
flaws

4. Try to stay within a family 
when substituting—for example, using 
prosciutto instead of speck, or leeks 
instead of onions

5. If you're ever going to truly love 
spending time in the kitchen, it needs 
to be a relatively stress-free, chill 
experience, and a sweaty morning spent 
in white-knuckled traffic hunting from 
fromagerie to market stall for ingredients 
is the total opposite of Zen

6. Come 
prepared, but be flexible, or, in the 
immortal words of Bobby McFerrin, don't 
worry, be happy

7. TIMING 
| already touched on timing in the 
“Everything You Need to Know About 
Cooking Your Stunning Noodles” section 
on page 64, and you might want to give it 
a once-over, especially regarding how to 
‘time sauce making with pasta cooking

8. I'll add a few sauce-specific hints for timing 
here

9. Please make sure you have 
everything you need chopped, sliced, 
diced, and ready to go on the counter 
before you start a sauce recipe

10. Many 
of the sauces come together quickly, 
and you'll be a lot less frazzled if you 
don’t have to pause what you're doing to 
unearth an ingredient from the pantry
