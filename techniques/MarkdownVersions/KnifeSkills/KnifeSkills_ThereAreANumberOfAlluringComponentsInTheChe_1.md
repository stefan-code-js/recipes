## Overview

There are a number of alluring components in the chestnut, squash, and 
cinnamon dish that chef Daniel Burns used to serve at his New York 
restaurant Luksus, but it's the blinding white shard of chestnut meringue 
that tells you what it will actually be like to eat the dessert. 
"When you see it, you can practically almost taste and feel the texture 
in your mouth," says Burns. As you eat the dish, he continues, "the textures play into

## Step-by-Step Instructions

1. There are a number of alluring components in the chestnut, squash, and 
cinnamon dish that chef Daniel Burns used to serve at his New York 
restaurant Luksus, but it's the blinding white shard of chestnut meringue 
that tells you what it will actually be like to eat the dessert

2. "When you see it, you can practically almost taste and feel the texture 
in your mouth," says Burns

3. As you eat the dish, he continues, "the textures play into 
it-you might want to smash the meringue so you can eat some of the crispy tex­
tures with more soft and juicy bites

4. As it does with Burns's meringue shard, texture can prime your expectations of 
a dish

5. It tells a story as effectively as color, form, or aroma do-arguably even more 
so, since it allows you to imagine the sensation of the food on your tongue

6. Texture 
also tends to evolve more than these other sensory aspects, as a plate of food is 
eaten, which can in turn heighten (or detract from) your enjoyment of a dish

7. So how do you create visual impact with texture and plate your food in 
such a way that it enhances your experience of it as you eat

8. One approach is the one that Burns used with both his chestnut me­
ringue and his dish of pickled mackerel, dulse, and tarragon, which was sheltered 
with a chip made from caramelized onions

9. Because the shard is the dominant fac­
tor in these two dishes, literally overshadowing the other components, it tells you 
that you're in for a lot of crunch-but also a lot of contrast with the softer textures 
on the plate
