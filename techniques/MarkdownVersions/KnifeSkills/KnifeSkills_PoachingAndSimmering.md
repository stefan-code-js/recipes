## Step-by-Step Instructions

1. Shallow poaching is  discussed on pages 443–444.

2. In quantity food service, this method is perhaps used most often for cooking large whole fish

3. According to the particular recipe, combine the finished sauce with egg yolk, hollandaise sauce,

4. Coat the fish with the sauce and run the plate or platter under the salamander or broiler for a few seconds, or until the sauce is golden brown.

5. Both fat and lean fish may be cooked by this method.

6. Seasoned liquid for cooking fish may be as simple as salted

7. Cook flavoring ingredients in court bouillon to extract the flavors before cooking the fish.

8. To cook seafood in court bouillon, follow the basic proce-dures for simmering and poaching detailed on pages 440–441. Cooking temperature is 160°–180°F (70°–80°C), well below boiling. A temperature of 160°F (70°C) is sufficient to cook fish, and it reduces the likelihood of overcooking. Higher temperatures are harmful to the delicate texture and flavor of fish.

9. Start shellfish, small fish, and portion cuts in hot liquid to preserve flavors. Start large fish in cold liquid to cook more evenly and to avoid sudden contractions that would split the skin and spoil the appearance.

10. Special fish poachers with racks are best for poaching. They allow the fish to be removed from the liquid without damage. If these utensils are not available, wrap the fish in cheese-cloth so it can be lifted out easily, or tie the fish loosely to a board.

11. Serve poached fish with an appropriate sauce, such as hol-landaise for hot fish and a mayonnaise-based sauce for cold fish. Mild vinaigrettes go well with both hot and cold poached fish.
