## Step-by-Step Instructions

1. the food should be cooked to the desired degree of doneness, as indicated by a thermometer

2. the surface of the food should be attractively browned. red meats should be well browned. White meats should be a rich golden to golden-brown. poultry should have a well-browned,

3. gravy made from the pan drippings should have an attractive color, a full, rich flavor, and the correct texture. unthickened jus should have body and not be watery, and thickened gravy should have a good nappé texture and not be thick and pasty.

4. 1. Collect all equipment and food supplies. Select roasting pans that have low sides (so mois-ture vapor does not collect around the roast) and that are just large enough to hold the roast. If pans are too large, drippings will spread out too thin and burn.

5. Prepare or trim the item for roasting. Heavy fat coverings on meat should be trimmed to about ½ inch (1 cm) thick.

6. If desired, season the item several hours ahead or the day before.

7. Preheat the oven to the desired temperature. Refer to the discussion of roasting tempera-tures above.

8. Optional step. Sear the meat under a broiler or in hot fat on the stove. This technique is use-ful for small items that may not brown enough during the roasting time.

9. Place the item on a rack in the roasting pan. In the case of meat cuts, the item should be fat side up. The rack holds the roast out of the drippings. Bones may be used if no rack is avail-able. Bone-in rib roasts need no rack because the bones act as a natural rack.

10. Insert a meat thermometer (clean and sanitary) so the bulb is in the center of the meat, not touching bone or fat. (Omit this step if you are using an instant-read thermometer.)

11. Do not cover or add water to the pan. Roasting is a dry-heat cooking method.

12. Place the item in a preheated oven.

13. Roast to desired doneness, allowing for carryover cooking.

14. If desired, add mirepoix to the pan during the last half of the cooking period.

15. Remove the roast from the oven and let stand in a warm place 15 to 30 minutes. This allows the juices to be reabsorbed through the meat so less juice is lost when the meat is sliced. Also, resting the meat makes slicing easier.

16. If the roast must be held, place it in an oven or warmer set no higher than the desired internal temperature of the roast.

17. While the roast is resting, prepare jus or pan gravy from the drippings (following the procedure on p. 204). Mirepoix may be added to the drippings now if it was not added in step 8.

18. Slice the roast as close as possible to serving time. In almost all cases, slice the meat against the grain for tenderness.

19. Evaluate the finished product (see above).
