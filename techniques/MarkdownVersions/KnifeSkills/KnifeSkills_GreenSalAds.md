Principles
salad greens must be fresh, clean, crisp, cold, and well drained, or the salad will be of poor quality. 
good greens depend on proper preparation.
Moisture and air are necessary to keep greens crisp.
1. leaves wilt because they lose moisture. Crispness can be restored by washing and refrigeration. 
The moisture that clings to the leaves after thorough draining is usually enough. Too much water drowns them and dissolves out flav

## Step-by-Step Instructions

1. leaves wilt because they lose moisture. Crispness can be restored by washing and refrigeration.

2. air circulation is essential for the greens to breathe. d o not seal washed greens too tightly or

3. Wash greens thoroughly.

4. Drain greens well. Lift greens from the water and drain in a colander. Tools and machines are available that quickly spin-dry greens. Poor draining results in a watered-down dressing and a soupy, soggy salad.

5. Crisp the greens. Refrigerate greens in a colander covered with damp towels or in a perforated storage bin to allow air circulation and complete drainage.

6. Cut or tear into bite-size pieces. Many people insist on tearing leaves instead of cutting, but this is a slow method if you have a large quantity to do. Also, you are more likely to crush or bruise the leaves.

7. Mix the greens. Toss gently until uniformly mixed. Nonjuicy raw vegetable garnish such as green pepper strips or carrot shreds may be mixed in at this time. Just make sure the vegetables are not cut into compact little chunks that will settle to the bottom of the bowl. Broad, thin slices or shreds stay better mixed.

8. and serve immediately. For pre-plated salads, proceed with steps 6 through 9.

9. Plate the salads (including underliners, if used). Cold plates, please. Don’t use plates right out of the dishwasher.

10. Garnish. Exceptions: (a) Garnish that is tossed with the greens in step 5. (b) Garnish that will not hold well (croutons will get soggy, avocado will discolor, etc.). Add these at service time.

11. Refrigerate.

12. Add dressing immediately before service, or serve it on the side.

13. greens should be fresh and bright, not wilted or browned.

14. except for some specialty salads, greens should be in bite-size pieces.

15. greens should have been properly dried before dressing and plating. Water clinging to improp-

16. Tossed salads should have just enough dressing to lightly coat all the greens. dressing should not pool on the bottom of the plate.

17. dressing should be appropriate to the greens. light, delicate greens require a lighter dressing, usually a vinaigrette. sturdier greens, such as romaine, can handle heavier dressings.
