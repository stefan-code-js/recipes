1. 4:15 A.M.:
 Scale out yeast and salt for the baguette mix and the ciabatta mix

2. Dump the
poolish, mixed the previous afternoon, into the bread mixer

3. Depending on the day
and the size of the mix, that’s between three and six tubs of poolish, which should

that give the top surface the appearance of tapioca

4. If you stare at it, you can see
occasional little eruptions as bubbles pop on the surface

7. 4:25 A.M.:
 Begin the baguette mix, on first speed

8. Set timer for 5 minutes

9. Take empty
poolish tubs to the dish pit and rinse them out
