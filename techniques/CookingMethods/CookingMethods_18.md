# Tarte au Citron et Craquelin #TabledAdrian #CulinaryArt #Dessert #Baking

**Preface:** A structured dessert combining the acidity of Menton lemon curd with the textural contrast of a crisp _craquelin_ shell and a light meringue.

Ingredients

- **Craquelin Dough:**

  - _Ingredients for Pâte à Choux_ (Milk, water, butter, sugar, salt, flour, eggs)

  - _Craquelin Topping_ (Butter, brown sugar, flour)

- **Lemon Curd:**

  - 150 g fresh lemon juice (Menton)

  - 150 g granulated sugar

  - 150 g whole eggs

  - 150 g unsalted butter (cubed, cold)

- **Meringue:**

  - 100 g egg whites

  - 200 g granulated sugar

**Method**

1. **Craquelin:** Prepare the _pâte à choux_ base. Pipe onto a baking tray. Top with a thin disc of _craquelin_ dough. Bake until the shell is crisp and hollow.

2. **Lemon Curd:** Combine lemon juice, sugar, and eggs. Cook over a _bain-marie_, stirring continuously until the mixture thickens to a nappe consistency (82°C).

3. Remove from heat. Gradually incorporate the cold, cubed butter using an immersion blender to emulsify and mount the curd. Chill immediately.

4. **Meringue:** Prepare a Swiss meringue by whisking egg whites and sugar over a _bain-marie_ to 60°C. Whip until stiff, glossy peaks are achieved.

5. **Assembly:** Fill the cooled _craquelin_ shell with the chilled lemon curd. Pipe the meringue onto the surface in a disciplined pattern. Finish with a torch to achieve a pale bronze colour.

**Technical Notes:** The _beurre monté_ technique is used to emulsify the cold butter into the hot curd, resulting in a smooth, stable, and intensely flavoured cream.

**Chef’s Intention:** A precise balance of acidity and sweetness, framed by the technical mastery of three distinct textures.• 250 g sugar

• 40 g water

- Season: Spring

- Ingredient: Lemon

- Dish Type: Tart\
  **Pairing Suggestion:** A chilled glass of Limoncello.
