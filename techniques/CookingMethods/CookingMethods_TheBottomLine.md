THE BOTTOM LINE
The beast in this book is not just the bell curve and the self-deceiving statistician, nor the Platonified scholar who needs theories to fool himself with.

2. It is the drive to “focus” on what makes sense to us

3. Living on our planet, today, requires a lot more imagination than we are made to have
