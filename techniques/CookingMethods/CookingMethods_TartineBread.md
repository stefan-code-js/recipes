## Step-by-Step Instructions

1. TARTINE BREAD
134oven is to place a rimmed baking sheet lined with water-soaked kitchen towels in 
the bottom of the oven as it is preheating

2. As the oven heats, the moisture in the 
towels produces steam

3. Ideally, you want the oven to be steaming for 15 minutes 
after you load the baguettes to bake

4. Take care to get the baguettes into the oven 
quickly and shut the door; the more steam that stays in the oven during the first 
part of baking, the better the oven spring, or volume, of the finished loaves

5. The 
steam will also help develop a thin, crisp crust with a slight sheen

6. Using rice flour, dust a pizza peel and dust the seam side of the baguettes

7. Holding the towel, flip each loaf onto a hand peel and then slide onto the pizza 
peel

8. Place the loaves side by side on the peel about 2 inches apart

9. With a double-
edged razor, score each loaf down the center with a series of slightly over lapping 
lines

10. Make sure your oven is fully saturated with steam; you’ll notice steam 
escaping from openings around the oven
