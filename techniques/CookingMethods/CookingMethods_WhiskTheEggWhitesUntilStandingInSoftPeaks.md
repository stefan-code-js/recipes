## Overview

371
Whisk the egg whites until standing in soft peaks.  
Gradually whisk in the sugar to make a glossy meringue. Warm the pastry cream to 95°F–105°F  (35°C–40°C ),  
beat with a whisk to lighten the texture, and then add the vanilla. 
Run a finger around the edge of each ramekin to remove  
any excess mixture. Bake for about 20  minutes, until nicely risen 
and slightly browned on top, without opening the oven door  
as this will keep the steam in the oven and ensure they rise fully.
