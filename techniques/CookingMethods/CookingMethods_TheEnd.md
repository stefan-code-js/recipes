## Step-by-Step Instructions

1. THE END
But all these ideas, all this philosophy of induction, all these problems with knowledge, all these wild opportunities and scary possible losses, everything palls in front of the following metaphysical consideration

2. I am sometimes taken aback by how people can have a miserable day or get angry because they feel cheated by a bad meal, cold coffee, a social rebuff, or a rude reception

3. Recall my discussion in
Chapter 8
on the difficulty
in seeing the true odds of the events that run your own life

4. We are quick to forget that just being alive is an extraordinary piece of good luck, a remote event, a chance occurrence of monstrous proportions

5. Imagine a speck of dust next to a planet a billion times the size of the earth

6. The speck of dust represents the odds in favor of your being born; the huge planet would be the odds against it

7. So stop sweating the small stuff

8. Don’t be like the ingrate who got a castle as a present and worried about the mildew in the bathroom

9. Stop looking the gift horse in the mouth—remember that you are a Black Swan

10. And thank you for reading my book.
