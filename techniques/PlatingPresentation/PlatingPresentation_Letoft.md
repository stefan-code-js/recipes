In this book I describe nine of our closest collaborators and producers. 
Many of them are large suppliers with whom we work closely on a daily 
basis. However, our network stretches much further and wider. A safe 
estimate would be around sixty or seventy people over the whole of 
the Nordic region. I can best describe the majority of these people as 
enthusiastic hobby farmers and growers, who can supply everything

## Step-by-Step Instructions

1. Hanne 
Letoft 
from 
South 
Zealand 
In this book I describe nine of our closest collaborators and producers

2. Many of them are large suppliers with whom we work closely on a daily 
basis

3. However, our network stretches much further and wider

4. A safe 
estimate would be around sixty or seventy people over the whole of 
the Nordic region

5. I can best describe the majority of these people as 
enthusiastic hobby farmers and growers, who can supply everything 
from forgotten varieties of gooseberry to pine shoots, young lambs 
from the West Jutland marshes to walnuts from the western part of 
Zealand

6. Ifwe were to describe them all they would fill a whole book 
just by themselves, and they perhaps deserve this one day-but one 
thing at a time

7. N oma's suppliers are generally people who also have a day job, or 
who have recently retired, and have always had some kind of interest 
in and access to farming or the countryside

8. For example, our supplier 
of wild blackberries is a seasoned football coach who sets time aside 
each year to forage on our behalf

9. Our supplier of samphire from the 
salt marshes on the west coast of Jutland works for the local butcher, 
and our walnut collector is a journalist with the BBC

10. Another good 
example is the director of a major Danish media company who keeps 
bees and sells us delicious honey every year
