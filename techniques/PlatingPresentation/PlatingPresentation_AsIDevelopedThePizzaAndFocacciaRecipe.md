## Overview

As I developed the pizza and focaccia recipes for this book, I was initially challenged,
as others before me, in figuring out how to get the best results using a standard home
oven with a pizza stone. I landed on the technique of placing the pizza stone in the upper
third of the oven and using a combination of baking and broiling. I was fascinated by
how good the pizza baked. I hope you get similar results.

## Step-by-Step Instructions

1. As I developed the pizza and focaccia recipes for this book, I was initially challenged,
as others before me, in figuring out how to get the best results using a standard home
oven with a pizza stone

2. I landed on the technique of placing the pizza stone in the upper
third of the oven and using a combination of baking and broiling

3. I was fascinated by
how good the pizza baked

4. I hope you get similar results

5. Oven Management and 
Preheating
Set your pizza stone on a rack in the upper portion of the oven so the surface is about 8
inches below the broiler

6. Preheat the oven to the highest heat setting possible; most home
ovens only go up to 500°F or 525°F (260°C or 274°C)

7. If you have a pizza oven that
goes higher, I recommend making your first pizzas at 600°F (316°C)

8. Save the super-
high-temperature baking until after you’ve done this a few times

9. Also, keep in mind that
every oven bakes differently, so pay attention and get the best using what you have

10. Once the oven has reached the target temperature, continue heating the pizza stone for
20 to 30 minutes, switching to the broil setting for the last 5 or so minutes
