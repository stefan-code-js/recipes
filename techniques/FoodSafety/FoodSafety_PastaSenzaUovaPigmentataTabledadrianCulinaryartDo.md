**Preface:** A vibrant, plant-based dough, utilizing vegetable powder to achieve visual intensity without compromising the integrity of the semolina structure.

**Ingredients**

- **Small Batch (1 serving):**

  - 75 g fine semolina

  - ½ tsp vegetable powder

  - 35 g warm water

- **Standard Batch (4 servings):**

  - 225 g fine semolina

  - 1.5 tsp vegetable powder

  - 105 g warm water

**Method**

1. Sift the semolina and vegetable powder together.

2. Introduce the tepid water gradually, ensuring the dough remains pliable but not sticky.

3. Knead the mass for 12 minutes to develop the gluten.

4. Rest the dough for 45 minutes, wrapped tightly, before rolling.

**Technical Notes:** The water temperature must be controlled (tepid) to facilitate gluten development without prematurely cooking the starch.
