4. Through the process of fermentation, yeast transforms the sugars in flour into carbon dioxide, which in turn makes dough and bread rise

5. Yeast also gives bread a distinctive aroma and flavor

6. Baker’s yeast comes in many forms: fresh (also known as cake or compressed yeast); active dry; instant; and rapid- or quick-rise

7. Most professional bakers and pastry chefs use fresh yeast, although active dry and instant yeasts (both dried) also produce excellent results if used properly

8. If a recipe calls for fresh yeast, use 50%  of the weight in active dry 
yeast or 40%  of the weight in instant yeast

9. Fresh and instant yeasts can be directly added to doughs, but
