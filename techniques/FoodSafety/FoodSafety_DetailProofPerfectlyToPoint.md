DETAIL 7: PROOF PERFECTLY TO POINT
After the dough has been shaped into loaves, it undergoes one final rise, called proofing.
This can take anywhere from one to sixteen hours, depending on the dough and the
ambient temperature. Just as you can slow a dough’s development during bulk
fermentation by putting it in a refrigerator or retarder, you can chill shaped loaves to
prolong the proofing process. Slowing the rise during either bulk fermentation or
proofing (but not both) is critical to achievi

## Step-by-Step Instructions

1. DETAIL 7: PROOF PERFECTLY TO POINT
After the dough has been shaped into loaves, it undergoes one final rise, called proofing

2. This can take anywhere from one to sixteen hours, depending on the dough and the
ambient temperature

3. Just as you can slow a dough’s development during bulk
fermentation by putting it in a refrigerator or retarder, you can chill shaped loaves to
prolong the proofing process

4. Slowing the rise during either bulk fermentation or
proofing (but not both) is critical to achieving the complexity of flavors we look for in
the breads at Ken’s Artisan Bakery

5. It also helps us manage our schedule and bake
previously shaped loaves as soon as we get into the bakery in the early morning

6. It’s usually difficult for home bakers to put bulk dough 
in the refrigerator overnight
because of the size of the 12-quart dough tubs I call for in this book

7. It’s easier to put
shaped loaves of bread in the refrigerator, so in this book, doughs are chilled only at the
proofing stage

8. Not only do you get improved flavor and better keeping quality from the
acidity that develops, but this overnight proof schedule also gives you the chance to bake
bread first thing in the morning

9. It’s a great way to start your day

10. The timing works this way: mix the dough in the afternoon, do the bulk fermentation at
room temperature following the recipe timing (usually around five hours), and then shape
the loaves in the evening
