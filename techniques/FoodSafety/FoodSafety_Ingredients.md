## Step-by-Step Instructions

1. I’ve had great results cooking pizza in my 9-inch cast-iron skillet

2. INGREDIENTS
The focus of this book is making great bread and pizza dough from just four ingredients:
flour, water, salt, and yeast

3. There are plenty of wonderful breads that include nuts,
whole grains, dried fruits, milk, butter, herbs, or cheese (I have had a great 
pain Gruyère
at Boulangerie Onfroy, in Paris)

4. But in my mind, the real craft of artisan bread baking
lies in producing something exquisite with only the four principal ingredients

5. Of course,
if you’re using only a few ingredients, quality is paramount, so let’s take a look at these
four basic ingredients and some of the considerations in regard to each

6. Flour
First, note that because temperature is such an important element of the equation when
making bread, you should use flour 
at room temperature for all of the recipes in this
book

7. Beyond that, my recommendations on flour come down to this: Use the best-quality
flour you can find, assessing its quality by both the appearance and the taste of the bread,
and seek out flour with protein in the 11 to 12 percent range

8. Unfortunately, protein
content is rarely detailed on flour packaging, but some brands do put this information on
their websites

9. These lower-protein flours have more in common with the flour used in
French and Italian artisan bakeries, and they tolerate a long rise well and produce a
crumb that is delicate and easy to digest
