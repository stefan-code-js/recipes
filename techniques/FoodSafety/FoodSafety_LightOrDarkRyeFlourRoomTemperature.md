ADJUSTING THE SCHEDULE
Sometimes you need to adjust timing for the recipe—either because you know in
advance that you need more time before working with the dough at the next stage, or
because something unexpected comes up and you realize you need to delay the
dough. Because bulk fermentation and proofing time are relative to the a

## Step-by-Step Instructions

1. Because bulk fermentation and proofing time are relative to the amount of
leavening and the temperature the dough is held at, you can use those variables to
give yourself more time

2. Note that I don’t advocate speeding up fermentation or
proofing, as this can adversely affect quality

3. Here’s an example: Say you want to make one of the Saturday Breads, but an
eight-hour bulk fermentation works better with your schedule than the five hours in
the recipe

4. In this case, I’d recommend reducing the amount of yeast by about a third
and keeping the temperatures the same

5. Make notes about what you do and how it
works out, then adjust the amount of yeast accordingly the next time

6. Here’s another example, still using the Saturday Breads

7. Say the day gets on, and
by the time you shape the loaves your evening’s plans have changed and you won’t
be around to bake the bread

8. Immediately after shaping, put the loaves in the
refrigerator (in their proofing baskets in nonperforated plastic bags)

9. Then bake
them the next morning
