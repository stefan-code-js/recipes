## Overview

warmer in summer. We use less yeast when it’s warmer, and more yeast when it’s
cooler. Alternatively, we could use the same amount of yeast and adjust the water
temperature up or down for mixing the pre-ferments.
DETAIL 3: USE THE AUTOLYSE METHOD
Every fermented dough in my bakery—be it bread, pizza, croissant, or brioche dough—
uses the autolyse method, where the flour and the liquid in the recipe are mixed and left

## Step-by-Step Instructions

1. We use less yeast when it’s warmer, and more yeast when it’s
cooler

2. Alternatively, we could use the same amount of yeast and adjust the water
temperature up or down for mixing the pre-ferments

3. The term 
autolysis
 was first applied to this process in the mid-1970s by French
baking icon Professor 
Raymond Calvel, who developed and promoted the technique

4. In
his book 
Le Goût du Pain
, available in English as 
The Taste of Bread
, Calvel wrote
about being driven to improve on industrial practices that resulted in overmixed and
overoxidized dough

5. Calvel’s mission was to educate and to restore the quality of French
bread baking, which had been in decline since the 1950s

6. The autolyse method allowed
for proper dough development with a shorter mixing time, thereby reducing oxidation
and improving the flavor of the bread

7. Overmixing and oxidation aren’t an issue in home
baking, being a by-product of mechanical dough mixers and commercial methods to
speed up production
