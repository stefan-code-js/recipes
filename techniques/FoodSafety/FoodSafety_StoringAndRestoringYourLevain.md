## Overview

STORING AND RESTORING YOUR LEVAIN
If you will not be making dough with your levain culture every day or don’t feel like
feeding it every day, you need to have a plan for storing your levain on those off days
and restoring it as needed. It’s best to store it in the refrigerator. After using it in a final
dough mix, take about 300 grams (1 cup + 3 tablespoons) of the remaining levain, coat it
with a film of water, and put it in a nonperforated plastic bag, then refrigerate for up to 1
month.

## Step-by-Step Instructions

1. STORING AND RESTORING YOUR LEVAIN
If you will not be making dough with your levain culture every day or don’t feel like
feeding it every day, you need to have a plan for storing your levain on those off days
and restoring it as needed

2. It’s best to store it in the refrigerator

3. After using it in a final
dough mix, take about 300 grams (1 cup + 3 tablespoons) of the remaining levain, coat it
with a film of water, and put it in a nonperforated plastic bag, then refrigerate for up to 1
month

4. When you’re ready to use it again, you’ll need to plan ahead in order to bring it back
and use it at full strength

5. Here’s the procedure I recommend:
STEP 1: TWO DAYS BEFORE YOU PLAN TO BAKE:
 Remove the levain from the refrigerator and put 200
grams (¾ cup) of it into your empty levain bucket

6. Discard the remainder

7. If possible, let
the levain sit out at room temperature for 30 to 60 minutes to warm up

8. Then add 100
grams (¾ cup + ½ tablespoon) of whole wheat flour, 400 grams (3 cups + 2
tablespoons) of white flour, and 400 grams (1¾ cups) of 95°F (35°C) water and mix by
hand until just incorporated

9. Cover and let rest in a warm spot overnight

10. STEP 2: THE MORNING OF THE DAY BEFORE YOU PLAN TO BAKE:
 Feed the levain again, using the same
feeding you use for daily levain: Discard all but 100 grams (⅓ cup + 1½ tablespoons) of
the levain
