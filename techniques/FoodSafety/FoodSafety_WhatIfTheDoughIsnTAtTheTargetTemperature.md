WHAT IF THE DOUGH ISN’T AT THE TARGET TEMPERATURE?
If the final mix temperature is cooler than 77ºF (25ºC), don’t worry—it may just
take longer to increase to 2½ times its original volume. Put the dough in a warm
spot, and use warmer water next time you make the recipe. If the dough temperature
is above 78ºF (26ºC), the dough will probably expand faster, depending on the
temperature of your kitchen. Use cooler water next time you make the recipe.
