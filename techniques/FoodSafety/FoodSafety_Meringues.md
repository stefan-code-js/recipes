## Step-by-Step Instructions

1. 231INTRODUCTION 
MERINGUES
Egg whites and sugar are the two ingredients needed to make three types of meringue

2. French 
meringue, Italian meringue, and Swiss meringue are prepared using different techniques, two of which require heat, and each meringue is used in a different way

3. NO TRACE OF FAT
The smallest amount of fat will prevent the whites from whipping up, so make sure the eggs are cleanly separated, with no flecks of yolk in the whites

4. And, of course, the mixing bowl and the whisk must be completely clean and dry as well

5. AT ROOM TEMPERATURE
Egg whites whip up far more easily at room temperature rather than being taken straight from the refrigerator, so remember to get them out at least 2 hours before making your meringue

6. The egg whites should be whisked with superfine sugar rather than confectioners’ sugar, as the latter contains starch, which will prevent the whites from whisking up properly

7. Sugars with larger crystals are not suitable, as they will not dissolve as well as superfine sugar when whisked with the egg whites

8. WHY ADD VINEGAR OR CREAM OF TARTAR TO FRENCH MERINGUE

9. Adding a few drops of white vinegar, lemon juice, or a pinch of cream of tartar to the meringue mixture results in a smoother texture and stops the whipped whites becoming granular and losing bulk
