## Overview

Retarder
 A cool chamber that literally retards the development of
the dough. At my bakery the retarder is a walk-in unit that holds six
rolling racks, and we hold the temperature at about 49ºF (9ºC). You
can use your refrigerator to retard loaves at home, as many recipes
in this book do.
There are several ways to extend fermentation time: you can reduce the amount of
yeast in the dough, you can reduce the temperature of the dough or of the area where it’s
is fermenting, or you can do both. If I

## Step-by-Step Instructions

1. Retarder
 A cool chamber that literally retards the development of
the dough

2. At my bakery the retarder is a walk-in unit that holds six
rolling racks, and we hold the temperature at about 49ºF (9ºC)

3. You
can use your refrigerator to retard loaves at home, as many recipes
in this book do

4. There are several ways to extend fermentation time: you can reduce the amount of
yeast in the dough, you can reduce the temperature of the dough or of the area where it’s
is fermenting, or you can do both

5. If I’m working with a levain dough that normally
reaches full maturity in an 80°F (27°C) room in three hours, I can put it in the retarder at
my bakery at 49°F (about 9°C) and it will instead take 
twelve hours to completely
develop

6. The extended, cold fermentation yields a better bread with a more complex
flavor and a rich, well-rounded aftertaste

7. While we do use cold bulk fermentation for
doughs at the bakery, doing so is less practical at home, where it can be difficult to find
room in the refrigerator for the 12-quart Cambro tubs that I recommend

8. For this book, I
adjusted recipes so that overnight doughs are bulk fermented with small amounts of yeast
at room temperature

9. You’ll notice that some doughs in this book are bulk fermented at
room temperature and then proofed overnight in the refrigerator at temperatures of 37°F
