## Step-by-Step Instructions

1. Combine the mayonnaise, vinegar, sugar, salt, and pepper in a stainless-

2. add the cabbage and mix well.

3. taste and, if necessary, add more salt and/or vinegar.1 fl oz 30 mL Vinegar

4. arrange the lettuce leaves as underliners on cold salad plates.

5. Using a No. 12 scoop, place a mound of coleslaw in the center of each plate.

6. hold for service in refrigerator.

7. Use Cooked Salad Dressing (p. 677) instead of mayonnaise. Reduce or omit vinegar.

8. Substitute sour cream for half of the mayonnaise.

9. Substitute heavy cream for 4 fl oz (125 mL) mayonnaise.

10. Substitute lemon juice for the vinegar.

11. Use 8 fl oz (250 mL) basic vinaigrette and omit mayonnaise and

12. Add 1 tsp (5 mL) celery seed to the basic mayonnaise dressing.

13. Neat, accurate cutting of ingredients is important because

14. Cut vegetables as close as possible to serving time, or they may dry or shrivel at the edges.

15. Cooked vegetables should have a firm, crisp texture and good color. Mushy, overcooked vegetables are unattractive in a salad. See Chapter 11 for vegetable cooking principles.

16. After cooking, vegetables must be thoroughly drained and chilled before being included in the salad.

17. Starches, pastas, and legumes should be cooked until com-pletely tender, but not overcooked. Starches absorb liquid from the dressing, so they may become mushy if they were overcooked. Undercooked grains and dried beans may be unpleasantly firm when cooled.

18. Vegetables are sometimes marinated, or soaked in a sea-soned liquid, before being made into salads, as for Mixed Bean Salad (p. 701). The marinade is usually some form of oil and vinegar dressing that also serves as the dressing for the salad. Do not plate marinated salads too far ahead of time, or the lettuce base will wilt. Use crisp, sturdy greens (such as iceberg, romaine, or chicory) as bases, as they do not wilt as quickly.

19. Grains and pastas may also be marinated for a short time, but avoid marinating for more than a few hours, as they are likely to absorb too much liquid and become very soft. This is espe-cially true of cooked pasta. Legumes should not be marinated long either, but for the opposite reason. The acid in the mari-nade may toughen the proteins in the beans or lentils.
