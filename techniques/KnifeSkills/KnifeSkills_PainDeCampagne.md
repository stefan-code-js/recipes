## Overview

PAIN DE CAMPAGNE
Pain de campagne
 is a rustic country bread that has a golden color to its crumb, subtle
round flavors from fermentation, and a chewy and delicious crust. It improves with age
for a couple of days after baking and can last nearly a week. This version has just a bit of
whole wheat flour in both the final dough ingredients and the levain culture. The whole
wheat flour boosts the energy of the fermentation and gives the final bread greater depth
of flavor and just a touch of acidit

## Step-by-Step Instructions

1. PAIN DE CAMPAGNE
Pain de campagne
 is a rustic country bread that has a golden color to its crumb, subtle
round flavors from fermentation, and a chewy and delicious crust

2. It improves with age
for a couple of days after baking and can last nearly a week

3. This version has just a bit of
whole wheat flour in both the final dough ingredients and the levain culture

4. The whole
wheat flour boosts the energy of the fermentation and gives the final bread greater depth
of flavor and just a touch of acidity on the palate

5. The long overnight proofing of the
loaves in the refrigerator allows a nice complexity of flavors to build

6. Once you have a
mature levain culture, this bread isn’t much work and really delivers on taste and texture
—and good looks

7. Many French bakers use a small amount of rye flour in bread they call 
pain de
campagne
 to give the crumb a slight grayish tint and a hint of rye flavor, whereas I use
whole wheat here

8. Feel free to play with the flour blend

9. Another mixture that I really
like in this recipe is 70 percent white flour, 20 percent whole wheat flour, and 10
percent whole rye flour

10. For guidance on playing around with 
flour blends, 
“Making a
Bread (or Pizza) Dough You Can Call Your Own.”
 Just make sure that the total amount
of flour in your final dough mix is the same as in this recipe—800 grams (200 grams of
flour are in the levain)
