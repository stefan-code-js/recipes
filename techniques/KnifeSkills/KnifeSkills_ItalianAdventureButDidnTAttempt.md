during the last, lean weeks of my first 
Italian adventure, but | didn’t attempt 
to re-create it for at least a decade, not

A few years later—punctuated by a 
trifling amount of growing up—Jonas, my 
boyfriend of three months who is now 
my husband, informed me that he was

## Step-by-Step Instructions

1. during the last, lean weeks of my first 
Italian adventure, but | didn’t attempt 
to re-create it for at least a decade, not 
wanting to soil the memory

2. A few years later—punctuated by a 
trifling amount of growing up—Jonas, my 
boyfriend of three months who is now 
my husband, informed me that he was 
transferring to Italy for his job, and he 
had negotiated an open-ended ticket for 
me, should | wish to join him

3. His exact 
words were: “I like you enough to bring 
you with me, but not enough to stay here 
for you.” Really, what person in their right 
mind would not move to Italy if the stars 
aligned

4. | was finishing a graduate degree 
| could easily do remotely, and despite 
having dated him for only a short time, | 
knew he wasn’t a psychopath, so | went 
along

5. We lived in Torino, the heart of the 
Piedmont region and, in my very unbiased 
opinion, the ne plus ultra of la vita bella

6. | steeped myself in Piemontese 
culture in those few years, but at first it 
was a land grab for knowledge that began 
with the pronunciation of cucchiaio

7. Cucchiaio is a four-syllable word that 
means “spoon” in Italian, and it’s initially 
hard for an American to pronounce— 
even if that American had, very recently 
prior to said pronouncing, nabbed an 
undergrad degree in Latin

8. Jonas and | had been there for a 
week and decided to quiz each other 
on basic words like forchetta, cucchiaio, 
and coltello

9. We were both really tripped 
6 PASTA, PRETTY PLEASE up on cucchiaio, which sounds like 
“coo-key-aye-oh.” Knowing we needed 
to commit it to memory, we decided to 
lob it back and forth across the table 
in a very quiet, very bright ristorante

10. If 
you've spent much time there, you know 
that the lights are almost always too 
bright in restaurants in Italy
