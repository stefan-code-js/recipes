## Overview

method, which I learned at the San Francisco 
Baking Institute, mimics the dough-cutting
action of good mechanical mixers. It effectively incorporates the ingredients and
distributes the salt and yeast throughout the mix.
At the end of the mix, measure the temperature of the dough with a probe thermometer.
In most of the recipes in this book, the target temperature is 77°F to 78°F (25°C to
26°C). Write down the 
final mix temperature and the time. If the dough temperature is
well below 77°F (25°

## Step-by-Step Instructions

1. method, which I learned at the San Francisco 
Baking Institute, mimics the dough-cutting
action of good mechanical mixers

2. It effectively incorporates the ingredients and
distributes the salt and yeast throughout the mix

3. At the end of the mix, measure the temperature of the dough with a probe thermometer

4. In most of the recipes in this book, the target temperature is 77°F to 78°F (25°C to
26°C)

5. Write down the 
final mix temperature and the time

6. If the dough temperature is
well below 77°F (25°C), it will take longer to rise, in which case you’ll need to follow
the recipe instructions regarding how much the dough should expand, rather than the
suggested time

7. Alternatively, 
you can compensate by placing the dough tub in a warm
spot for the rise—75°F to 80°F (24°C to 27°C) should work

8. You
may make adjustments that better suit your schedule for future mixes—a little more yeast
if the dough wasn’t ready in five or six hours, or a little less yeast if the dough moved too
fast

9. Use warmer or cooler water next time if your mix temperature was below or well
above 78°F (26°C)
