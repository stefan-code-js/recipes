## Overview

Celeriac Shawarma 
Thin slices of celeriac are cooked in truffle juice and brown butter, then 
sandwiched with alternating fine layers of linseed fudge, truffle puree, 
and celeriac puree and sliced to reveal the strata. 
The slices are slowly grilled over coals laid with Douglas fir, and 
brushed generously with shawarma cooking glaze until lightly smoked 
and caramelized. 
Greens are barely wilted by bathing with a butter emulsion. Large 
leaves embrace smaller greens and herbs to form a wrap.
