## Step-by-Step Instructions

1. 0.4 g Blueberry Reduction*  
3 Semi -Dried Black Currants  
2 black currant shoots  
Milk Ice Cream  
Black Currant Wood Oil*  
Put a Pacojet container of milk ice cream in the blast chiller for at least an hour before spinning
it

2. Once spun, transfer the ice cream to a piping bag, and keep cold in the fridge

3. Take one o f the
c
hestnut mochi leaves, and flip it upside down, so the imprint of the leaf is not facing you

4. Cut  a
s
mall hole in the tip of the piping bag of chestnut praline

5. Starting about 2 mm from the edge o f
th
e leaf, trace the shape of the leaf with the chestnut praline all the way around the leaf

6. Repeat
this process 4 times

7. We are trying to build up an edge, so each line of praline is piped on top ofthe previous one

8. After repeating this process 4 times, put the leaves in the blast chiller for a few minute s so that what has already been piped will set

9. After a few minutes, take the leaves
from the freezer and pipe along the chestnut praline another 4 times

10. In total, we should have 8rounds of chestnut praline around the edge of the leaf
