## Step-by-Step Instructions

1. Lacto-Fermented Fruits and Vegetables

2. tasty when raw and (2) juicy but not mushy. The latter trait is important because so much of a pickle’s appeal is its crunch. (As any Scandinavian will tell you, slices of cured fish garnished with bits of pickled vegetables are one of life’s great textural partnerships.) We’ve had amazing success making lacto-fermented pickles from white asparagus, small pumpkins, beets, and cabbage stems. Leafy greens like watercress and ramsons have been . . . less rewarding.

3. Plums and salt.

4. Halve the plums with a paring knife.

5. Carefully remove the pits and discard.

6. Weigh the halved, pitted plums, then mix with 2% of their weight in salt.

7. Vacuum-seal the bag on maximum suction, leaving an ample amount of headroom.

8. Let the plums ferment for 5 to 7 days, or until the taste is to your liking.

9. “Burp” the bag by cutting a small hole in a corner and releasing the air. Taste the fruit to check your progress, then reseal the bag.

10. Somewhere between 5 and 7 days, the plums should be ready. Strain the liquid and reserve.

11. Transfer the plums to a sealed container and store in the refrigerator, or freeze them in a single layer to maintain their shape.
