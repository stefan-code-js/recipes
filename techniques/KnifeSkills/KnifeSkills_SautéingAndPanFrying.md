SAUTÉING AND PAN-FRYING
according to the basic definitions given in chapter 6, the main differences between sautéing and 
pan-frying are the amount of fat used and the cooking time. Sautéing means cooking quickly in a 
small amount of fat. the product is often tossed or flipped in the pan over high heat. Pan-frying  
means cooking in a larger amount of fat, usually for a longer time at lower heat, and the product is 
not tossed or flipped. i n practice, the two met

## Step-by-Step Instructions

1. this is the general

2. the basic procedure for vegetables is illustrated by the recipe on page 330.

3. Collect all equipment and food products.

4. Prepare vegetables as required. Preparation may include

5. Place a sauté pan or cast-iron skillet on moderately high heat. Add required amount of fat to the pan and let it heat.

6. Place prepared vegetables in the pan. Adjust the heat so the product cooks through with the desired amount of brown-ing but without burning the outside.5. Turn vegetables with a spatula and continue to cook until done.

7. Remove from pan. If necessary, drain on absorbent paper to eliminate excess fat.

8. Evaluate the quality of the cooked vegetable. In addition to the quality standards on page 281, pan-fried vegetables that have been breaded or given another coating have a crisp exterior that has been attractively browned but not charred.PROCEDURE for Sautéing Vegetables

9. Collect all equipment and food products.

10. Prepare vegetables as required.

11. Place sauté pan on high heat.

12. When the pan is hot, add a small amount of clarified butter, oil, or other fat, enough to coat the bottom of the pan. (Clarified butter is used because the milk solids in whole butter burn quickly at the high heat necessary for sautéing.)

13. As soon as the fat is hot, add the vegetable. Do not overload the pan, or the temperature will be lowered too much and the vegetables will simmer instead of sauté.

14. After the heat has recovered, flip the pan a few times to turn and toss the vegetables (Fig. 12.4). Let the pan set again over the heat.

15. Continue to flip the vegetables as often as necessary for them to cook or heat evenly and become coated with the cooking fat. (Don’t flip more than necessary, however. Too much flipping may break fragile vegetables. Also, the heat must have time to recover between flips.)

16. As soon as the vegetables are cooked, or heated through if precooked, remove from the pan. Evaluate the quality of the cooked vegetable (p. 281). Browning may or may not be desirable, depending on the vegetable and the particular preparation.
