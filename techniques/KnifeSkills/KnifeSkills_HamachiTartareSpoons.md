## Overview

HAMACHI TARTARE SPOONS
serves 6
If you start with high-quality hamachi or yellowfin tuna, it is hard to miss with this dish. The quality of the fish is what this is all about. You will end up with very clean, buttery tartare—one that is satisfyingly rich and fun to serve. If you can’t find hamachi, which is young yellowtail tuna, substitute another tuna, or salmon, snapper, or swordfish. A spoonful of this one-bite amuse is all you need, particularly when it’s garnished with silken crème fraîche

## Step-by-Step Instructions

1. Cut the hamachi into very small dice. Mince the red onion very fine to measure about ½ cup. Toss the hamachi and onion together in a small glass or ceramic bowl along with the lime leaves.

2. Add the citrus juices and toss gently. Season to taste with salt and pepper and refrigerate for no longer than 15 minutes.

3. Mound some tartare mixture in the bowl of a large dessert spoon or another decorative spoon. Using a second spoon of the same size, form the tartare into an oval, or quenelle. Remove the top spoon. The tartare will be served on the first spoon.

4. To serve, spread a thin layer of crème fraîche over the tartare and garnish with some of the hijiki. Repeat to make 5 more spoons. Arrange the spoons on a mirror.
