## Step-by-Step Instructions

1. We hope you get a pure and unpretentious experience, and the staff 
help to create this mood by meeting the guests on an equal footing

2. By having the cooks serve the food we demonstrate that, when it comes 
down to it, it's all about their handiwork and not the packaging

3. 'When they 
can look the guests in the eye, it results in a much more concentrated 
effort than if they stand there peeling potatoes in a stainless steel­
clad cellar

4. The long days, the extreme stress and the constant high 
level of concentration make it more meaningful for the cooks, who get 
to know one of the most humble and important elements ofrunning 
a restaurant, namely the sensation and emotion of giving

5. And at the 
same time they realize that their work is appreciated', explains Rene

6. Every month, sometimes every week or every day, Noma is subject to 
the vagaries of the season, so changes to the menu are gradual but 
constant

7. The tempo is dictated by the availability of raw materials

8. As a result, there is no fixed structure to the compilation of a menu

9. All the same, Rene endeavours to keep some degree of consistency
