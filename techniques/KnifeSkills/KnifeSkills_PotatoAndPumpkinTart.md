## Step-by-Step Instructions

1. POTATO AND PUMPKIN TART  
NEW POTATO TART SHELL  
10 Danish new potatoes (2 mm diameter, as round as possible)  
Koji Oil*  
Sort through the potatoes to find the ones that are the roundest

2. Wash the potatoes and slic e
t
hem on a mandolin as thinly  as possible (if they’re too thick, the potatoes won’t set together)

3. Slice no more than 5 potatoes at a time or  do this entire process with two people

4. We don’t 
want to put the potatoes into water because they will curl, so we need to work quickly to avoid
oxidation

5. Cut a circle of parchment paper measuring 7.5 cm in diameter

6. Brush the paper with koji oil and
lay the potatoes out

7. Start 3 mm from the edge of the parchment round and continue in an 
overlapping pattern until you complete and fill in a circle

8. Put this round of parchment paper with the laid -out potato slices on the top of a yogurt pot lid

9. Brush the potatoes with koji oil, add
another parchment round on top, and finally another yogurt pot lid

10. The idea is to sandwich thepotato slices between parchment paper rounds and inside of two yogurt pot lids to keep the potato slices flat when cooked
