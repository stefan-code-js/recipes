## Step-by-Step Instructions

1. Cut a 10-inch square of cheesecloth and place the onions, carrot, and celery in the center of the square. Bring the corners of the cloth together and tie the sachet with kitchen string.

2. Put the bulgur and vegetable sachet in a large pot of lightly salted boiling water. Reduce the heat and simmer for 10 to 12 minutes or until the bulgur is just tender. Drain in a colander and discard the sachet. Allow to cool, then transfer about 1 cup of the bulgur to a bowl.

3. Toss the cup of bulgur with as much olive oil as needed to coat the grains lightly. Season to taste with salt and pepper.

4. In a food processor, fitted with the metal chopping blade, or blender, puree the toasted walnuts with 3 to 4 tablespoons of olive oil until chunky-smooth.

5. Remove and discard the stems from the watercress. Reserve the leaves.

6. To serve, place about 2 tablespoons of the bulgur salad on each of 6 small plates along with some of the walnut puree. Garnish each serving with watercress leaves.
