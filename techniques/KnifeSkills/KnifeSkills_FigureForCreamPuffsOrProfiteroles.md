2. Using a pastry bag with a star tube, pipe choux paste onto the parchment in circles (doughnut

3. Slide the paper with the paste into a deep fryer heated to 375°F (190°C). Remove the paper as the doughnuts release and float free.

5. When cooled, drizzle fondant icing over the tops.PROCEDURE for Making Cream Puffs and Profiteroles

6. Line sheet pans with silicone paper, or butter them lightly.

7. Fit a large pastry bag with a plain tube. Fill the bag with the choux paste.

8. For cream puffs, pipe round mounds of dough about 1½ inches (4 cm) in diameter onto the lined baking sheets (Fig. 36.9).

9. Bake at 425°F (215°C) for 10 minutes. Lower the heat to 375°F (190°C) until the puffs are well browned and very crisp.

10. Remove from the oven and cool slowly in a warm place.

11. When cool, cut a slice from the top of each puff. Fill with whipped cream, Vanilla Pastry Cream (p. 1023), or desired filling, using a pastry bag with a star tube.

12. Replace the tops and dust with confectioners’ sugar.

13. Fill the puffs as close to service as possible. If cream-filled puffs must be held, refrig-erate them.

14. Unfilled and uncut puffs, if they are thoroughly dry, may be held in plastic bags in the refrigerator for 1 week. Recrisp in the oven for a few minutes before use.

15. Proceed as for cream puffs, except pipe the dough into strips about ¾ inch (2 cm) wide and 3–4 inches (8–10 cm) long (Fig. 36.10). Bake as for cream puffs.
