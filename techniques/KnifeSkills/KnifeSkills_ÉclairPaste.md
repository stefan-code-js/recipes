ÉClaIr  paste
Éclairs and cream puffs are made from a dough called éclair paste or choux paste. the French name 
pâte à choux (pot a shoo) means “cabbage paste, ” referring to the fact that cream puffs look like 
little cabbages.
Unlike puff pastry, éclair paste is extremely easy to make. the dough itself can be prepared in 
just a few minutes. this is fortunate because for best baking results, the dough should not be pre -
pared ahead of time.
