## Step-by-Step Instructions

1. review the information on preparing consommé, page 237.

2. Combine the beef, mirepoix, egg whites, tomatoes, herbs, and spices in a tall, heavy stockpot. Mix vigorously with a wooden paddle or a heavy whip.8 oz 250 g Onion

3. add about 1 pint (500 mL) cold stock and stir well. Let stand about

4. Gradually stir in the remaining cold stock. Be sure the stock is well mixed with the other ingredients.

5. Set the pot on moderately low heat and let it come to a simmer very slowly. Stir occasionally.

6. When the simmering point is approaching, stop stirring.

7. Move the pot to lower heat and simmer very slowly about 1¼ hours.

8. Very carefully strain the consommé through a china cap lined with several layers of cheesecloth.

9. Degrease thoroughly.

10. Season to taste.

11. Clarifying hot stock.

12. Clarifying without meat.In a pinch, you can clarify a stock with egg whites alone. Use at least 3 or 4 egg whites per gallon (4 L) stock, plus mirepoix

13. Failed clarification.If the clarification fails because you let it boil, or for some other reason, it can still be rescued, even if there is no time

14. Poor color.Beef or veal consommé made from brown stock should have an amber color. It is not dark brown like canned consommé. Chicken consommé is a very pale amber.
