## Step-by-Step Instructions

1. 49 Southeast Asia
No other country along the spice route embraced  
the chilli pepper as enthusiastically as Thailand

2. It’s 
impossible to imagine Thai cuisine without liberal quantities of chilli, though the blander flavours of the Cambodian kitchen do hint at what pre-chilli Thai food would have tasted like

3. Other spice staples were less eagerly adopted and, like cooks in land-locked Laos, Thai chefs still prefer freshly pounded spice pastes

4. Its unique texture 
means nothing else can be 
used as a substitute

5. 5 tbsp uncooked glutinous  
(“sticky”) rice
1 lemongrass stalk, sliced 
1 thumb-sized piece of galangal, sliced
3 makrut lime leaves, roughly torn
Dry-roast all the ingredients  
in a frying pan, over a medium heat, 
stirring frequently, until the rice turns 
golden brown

6. Leave to cool, then 
pick out the spices and pound the 
rice using a pestle and mortar until 
coarsely ground.Signature
Chilli, garlic, coriander  
root, lemongrass
All four fresh spices are  near ubiquitous in Thai and Laotian cuisine

7. Cambodian cooks use less chilli but get enthusiastically stuck into  the rest

8. Supporting
Lime leaf, galangal, ginger, 
krachai (wild ginger),  black pepper, tamarind
Several roots in the ginger family, along with makrut lime leaves, provide further fresh flavours, while tamarind is drawn on for sour notes, and black or white pepper  for slow-burning heat

9. Supplementary
Turmeric, clove, nutmeg, 
cinnamon, fennel, cardamom, pandan leaf, green pepper
Although widely available throughout the region,  dry spices tend to find  their way into a limited number of dishes rather  than everyday cooking
