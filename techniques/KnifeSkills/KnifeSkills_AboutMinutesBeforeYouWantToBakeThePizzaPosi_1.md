## Step-by-Step Instructions

1. for pizza that evening, be sure not to shape the dough balls too tightly, and give the dough
balls at least an hour to relax before forming the pizza

2. Also note that cold dough is
easier to shape than dough at room temperature

the oven, then preheat the oven to 525°F (274°C)

4. If your oven only goes to 500°F
(260°C), that’s fine; the pizza will just take a bit longer to bake

5. When you’re ready to

6. Holding the rim, stretch the
dough to a circle about 9 inches in diameter, then put it in a dry, room temperature 9-inch
cast-iron skillet
