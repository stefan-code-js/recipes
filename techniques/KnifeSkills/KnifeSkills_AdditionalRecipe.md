## Step-by-Step Instructions

1. In addition, observe the following guidelines:

2. Because of the intense heat of the broiler, great care is

3. Select appropriate fish for broiling or grilling. Small slices and thin fillets are usually too delicate to be placed directly on the grid of a broiler or grill. Arrange them on oiled sheet pans, broiler platters, or other baking dishes or pans, and cook under a broiler.
