## Step-by-Step Instructions

1. arraNGING  the SaL aD

2. Keep the salad off the rim of the plate.

3. Strive for a good balance of colors. Plain iceberg lettuce looks pale and sickly all by itself, but it can be enlivened by mixing in darker greens and perhaps a few shreds of carrot, red cabbage, or other colored vegetable. On the other hand, don’t go overboard. Sometimes just a few shades of green create a beautiful effect. Too many colors might look messy.

4. Height helps make a salad attractive. Ingredients mounded on the plate are more interesting than if they are spread flat. Lettuce cups as bases add height. Often just a little height is enough. Arrange ingredients like fruit wedges or tomato slices so they overlap or lean against each other rather than lie flat on the plate.4. Cut ingredients neatly. Ragged or sloppy cutting makes the whole salad look sloppy and haphazard.

5. Make every ingredient identifiable. Cut every ingredient into large enough pieces that the customer can recognize each immediately. Don’t pulverize everything in the buffalo chopper or VCM. Bite-size pieces are the general rule, unless the ingredient can be cut easily with a fork, such as tomato slices. Seasoning ingredients, like onion, may be chopped fine.

6. Keep it simple. A simple, natural arrangement is pleasing. An elaborate design, a gimmicky or contrived arrangement, or a cluttered plate is not pleasing. Besides, elaborate designs take too long to make.
