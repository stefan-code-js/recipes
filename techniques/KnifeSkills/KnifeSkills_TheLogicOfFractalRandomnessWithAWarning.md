## Overview

THE LOGIC OF FRACTAL RANDOMNESS (WITH A WARNING)
*
I have shown in the wealth lists in
Chapter 15
the logic of a fractal distribution: if wealth doubles from 1 million to 2 million, the incidence of people with at least that much money is cut in four, which is an exponent of two. If the exponent were one, then the incidence of that wealth or more would be cut in two. The exponent is called the “power” (which is why some people use the term
power law)
. Let us call the number of occurrences highe

## Step-by-Step Instructions

1. You can extrapolate to estimate that around 34 books will sell more than 500,000 copies—simply 96 times (500,000/250,000)

2. and the author’s own calculations

3. More significantly, this exponent begins to apply at some number called “crossover,” and addresses numbers larger than this crossover. It

4. You do not see what is inside the engine, only the data coming out. If I ask you what the exponent is, odds are that you will compute something like 2.4. You would do so even if you had a million data points. The reason is that it takes a long time for some fractal processes to reveal their properties, and you underestimate the severity of the shock.
