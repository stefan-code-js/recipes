## Step-by-Step Instructions

1. Fish cooks very quickly, even at low heat (just enough heat to coagulate the proteins).

4. Cooked fish must be handled very carefully or it will fall apart.

5. the fish just separates into flakes—that is, it is beginning to flake but does not yet fall

6. if bone is present, the flesh separates from the bone, and there is no longer any trace of pink next to the bones.

7. the flesh has turned from translucent to opaque (usually white, depending on the kind of fish).
