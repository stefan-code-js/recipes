## Overview

Milk Skin and Truffle 
Full-fat milk is reduced in a wide skillet until all that's left is a skin, 
which is slowly cooked until lightly caramelized. The caramelized milk 
skin is punched into rounds, and two rounds are sandwiched around 
parsley, lemon thyme, and a disc of soft cheese with a bit of its rind. 
The milk skin pocket is fried and truffle puree is piped on top. Sliced 
preserved truffles are shingled over the whole surface and the dish is 
finished with salt and cep oil.
