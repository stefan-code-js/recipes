steaks and fillets and with small fish. Baking is also a popular method for preparing shellfish such as 
stuffed clams or oysters.

## Step-by-Step Instructions

1. MOISt  BaKING Or  BraISING

2. Fat fish are better for baking because they are less likely

3. Lean fish may be baked successfully if great care is taken not to overcook them. Basting with butter or oil helps pre-vent drying.

4. In most cases, baking temperatures are from 350° to 400°F (175° to 200°C). Large fish are best baked at the lower end of this range so they bake more evenly.

5. It is not possible to give specific baking times because fish vary so much in shape and composition. Different ingredi-ents and types of baking pans also affect the baking time. The following guideline is helpful, however: Measure the thickness of the fish at the thickest point. At 400°F (200°C), baking time is about 10 minutes per inch (2.5 cm) of thickness.

6. Serving baked fish with a sauce or seasoned butter enhances its moistness and improves palatability. Serving with lemon also enhances the fish.

7. If fish is baked with a moist topping or sauce, strictly speaking, it is no longer being cooked by a dry-heat method. However, because the basic procedure is the same, the fish is treated as if it were.

8. Collect all equipment and food supplies.

9. Prepare and season fish (whole, steaks, fillets) as directed in the recipe.

10. Place the fish on oiled or buttered baking sheets. Brush tops with oil or butter.

11. Apply toppings, if desired. Examples: seasoned bread

12. Bake at 350° to 400°F (175° to 200°C) until done. If the fish is lean and has no moist topping, baste with oil or butter during baking.
