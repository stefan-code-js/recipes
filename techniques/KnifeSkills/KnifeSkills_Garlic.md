sweet pulp and add to pumpkin or other vegetable soups

5. Prawns Add to an oily marinade for 
grilled or barbecued prawns

6. Raw vegetables Pound garlic with 
anchovies and olive oil to make the Provençal paste anchoïade, and serve with crudités

cloves to the mortar or blender when making hummus

phenols and sulphur compounds
