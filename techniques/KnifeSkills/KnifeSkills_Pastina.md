## Overview

PASTINA

the making of the pattern. Rather than

## Step-by-Step Instructions

1. PASTINA 
Many of the pasta pattern techniques 
you'll learn in the coming pages require 
you to repeatedly punch out the same 
shape using a plunger cutter

2. These 
pasta shapes-—little stars, hearts, or dots, 
for example—are very pretty on their 
own but serve no further purpose in 
the making of the pattern

3. Rather than 
scrap them, | save all of my little shapes, 
called pastina, or “tiny pasta,” in Italian

4. Because they don’t have much surface 
area, they dry very well without cracking, 
unlike larger pasta

5. | let them dry fully, 
then store them in an open jar, because 
an airtight container encourages mold 
growth

6. When | have a few handfuls, | 
toss them into thin, brothy soups, or even 
just store-bought chicken stock if I’m in 
a pinch

7. Colorful pastina in brodo is the 
ultimate sick-kid comfort food, because 
in addition to being easily digestible, it’s 
also fun to eat

8. STORING, FREEZING, AND 
DRYING PASTA 
| rarely freeze pasta, with the exception 
of gnocchi and unsheeted pasta 
dough, which both freeze well

9. Freeze 
gnocchi in a single layer, then store in 
an airtight freezer bag

10. Store unsheeted 
pasta dough in a freezer bag or sealed 
Foodsaver bag
