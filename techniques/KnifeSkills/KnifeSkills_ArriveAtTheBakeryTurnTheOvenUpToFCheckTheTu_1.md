## Step-by-Step Instructions

1. 3:30 A.M.:
 Arrive at the bakery

2. Turn the oven up to 500°F

3. Check the tubs of poolish
and biga for the morning mixes to see if they’re at their ideal point of maturation
and ready to be used in the dough mixes

4. Remove sheet pans of croissants and other

around 6 a.m

6. If it’s chilly in the bakery, put the rack in front of the oven

7. Remove 50-pound bags of flour from the retarder, where they were chilled
overnight to allow for a proper finished dough temperature in the heat of the bakery
(friction from the dough mixer adds heat to the dough too)

 Autolyse the baguette dough

9. Scale the flour, usually 60 to 80 kilos
(depending on what is specified on today’s mix sheets) and dump it in the mixer
