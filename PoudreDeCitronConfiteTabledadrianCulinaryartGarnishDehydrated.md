**Preface:** A concentrated, sweet-acidic powder, achieved through the disciplined process of blanching, confit, and dehydration of Menton lemon peel.• Water for blanching

**Ingredients**

- **Base:**

  - 100 g lemon skins (Menton)

  - 300 g water

  - 300 g granulated sugar

  - Water (for blanching)

**Method**

1. **Blanching:** Blanch the lemon peels in boiling water precisely five times, refreshing the water each time, to remove bitterness.

2. **Confit:** Combine the sugar and 300 g of water to create a syrup. Introduce the blanched peels and cook gently until the peels are translucent.

3. Remove the peels from the syrup.

4. **Dehydration:** Dehydrate the peels overnight at 60°C until completely dry and brittle.

5. **Finish:** Mill the dehydrated peels into a fine powder. Store in an airtight container to maintain crispness.
